# Our Fundamentals

Every code created must be open source.<br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

And of course, we should be forming a donation culture for giving thanks in tokens to the creators of ideas and code.<br>

When people create something not good enough, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it — to improve it.

 <h1 align="center">THE VOTE BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
 
<p>&nbsp</p>
 <h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>

The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless ownership systems whose pre-programmed works are extremely hard – at best, impossible  – to stop.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to build these systems such swift and efficient as possible.
 
 

<h1 align="center">5 Problems of Current Blockchains</h1>

<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

The problem 1 is that we (people) build blockchains the same way as we built states: 

with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

Ideally, blockchains must to be truly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

**For reference, Solana's routine -- on its best times -- was about 30 million transactions per day. At the peak, 65 million. So a massive voting (by, say, 1 million voters) isn't any problem now in terms of technology.**


<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

The problem 2 is the inability of each of the existing blockchains to truly start decreasing its Circulating Supply.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.


<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

The problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in gas prices which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in gas prices, must never lead to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive — instead, this whole token increase received must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

The problem 4 is that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one truly-decentralized way for a blockchain to build up its "51% attack" resistance:

to increase a number of honest nodes in the blockchain.

This approach results in the fact that the more the blockchain's market capitalization becomes, the more nodes this blockchain strives to add.

At the same time, the increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, such an approach means that increasing overhead (efficiency) is the target for each of the existing blockchains.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, more efficient, truly-decentralized way to build up its "51% attack" resistance -- of course, remaining truly-decentralized and truly-democratic.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

The problem 5 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for validators and developers if calculated per person.

Ideally, a blockchain must create highly generous incentives for validators and developers when calculated per person -- in order to be a more sustainable working system.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

**Motto: Like Others Just Better**



<h1>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h1>

Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.



<h1>2 &nbsp Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution</h1>

At the start, through a fair airdrop, all the Vote tokens (100%) for free are equally distributed among 1,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting.



<h1>3 &nbsp 50,000 TPS</h1>

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 



<h1>4 &nbsp Free Transactions</h1>

There are no Gas fees for simple transactions, meaning, it is a freemium model blockchain.

A simple transaction is a transaction performing a transfer of tokens from one address not associated with a smart contract to another address also not associated with a smart contract.

Simply put, this includes, among other cases, that each transfer of tokens from one regular user to another is for free and that each transfer of tokens involving a smart contract will be with a Gas fee.

*An user, if there is congestion (if ever), may set a Gas fee for their simple transaction, meaning, only at its worst the Vote blockchain might take Gas fees for simple transactions – while each of the existing blockchains always does it -- because any transactions without Gas fees aren't possible on regular blockchains.*



<h1>5 &nbsp Possible DDoS/Spam Attacks</h1>

Possible DDoS/Spam attacks, due to the fact that all simple transactions are free and hence can be created in enormous amounts, are beaten the same way as it is already done in relation to other possible DDoS/Spam attacks that can, for example, be requesting the Block Height.



<h1>6 &nbsp Gas Fees</h1>

Users pay Gas Fees only for some sorts of transactions.

Specifically, an user pays a Gas fee for deploying a smart contract and for making a transaction involving a smart contract.

Gas fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).


<h1>7 &nbsp Order of Transactions in Each Block</h1>

During each 400-millisecond slot, from the transactions received but yet not executed, the ordered list of transactions (maximum ~ 20,000) is automatically formed in the following order:

1. transactions with Gas fees are automatically ordered in descending order of Gas

2. simple transactions without Gas fees are automatically ordered with a random number algorithm.

If the total number of transactions, received but yet not executed, is bigger than the maximum block size (~20,000 transactions) – the remaining transactions will participate in competition during the next slot, according to the same order described above.

*This approach greatly reduces an unjust value-extraction done by miners/validators on AMM exchanges, not excluding an unjust value-extraction done by algorithmic traders, and plus, of course, completely excludes this phenomenon on order-book exchanges.*



<h1>8 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h1>

From the start, all Gas fees, received on each block, are burned, resulting in a decrease of  the Vote token's Circulating Supply.

At best, such an extremely deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of Vote Token over time.

**To be continued a bit below...**





<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>

* New Approach to Consensus
* Decentralization which is sufficient
* True Decentralization Being Highly Efficient


## New Approach to Consensus

This new approach doesn't require stakes from Validators (unlike POS) and of course doesn't require doing hash-works (unlike POW). 

Nevertheless, the approach includes Solana's Proof-Of-History -- but Proof-Of-History without stakes.

The approach is highly efficient and might be used by a truly-decentralized and truly-democratic blockchain which one, for example, the Vote blockchain is.


<p align="center"><b>For reference, about Solana</b></p>


At any given moment, the Solana Blockchain is storing the full list of all current Validators. 

All the Validators being on the list should have the same hardware capabilities.

Also, at any given moment, there is only one Validator (leader-Validator) which is creating a block.

Only the leader-Validator can create a block and stream the block to other Validators.

All other Validators are only verifying the work of the leadr-Validator.

So the creation of the block by the leader and the verification of the block by others are happening in parallel. 

Each leader-Validator is automatically selected (calculated) from the list by a stake-weighted selection algorithm and then is automatically rotated with another Validator according to the leader schedule also calculated automatically by a stake-weighted selection algorithm.

Importantly, at any given moment, there is the list of all working Validators, meaning, any Validator being out of the list cannot be participating in the work and cannot be harming the consensus.

Plus, any Validator being in the list, just trying doing something wrong, will be punished by slashing its stake -- and, theoretically, might be dropped out of the list.

The hypothesis/idea is that 

when for a Validator being in the list, there is no need to have significant money and put it as the stake, and 

when for the Validator, there are highly generous incentives to work properly (say, $5 million annually), 

then this Validator from the list will work properly. Honestly.

So we might, for example, just drop out the Solana's stake-weighted selection algorithm, used to automatically (1)select (calculate) the leader-Validator from the list and (2)calculate the leader schedule from the list,  -- and replace it with a random number selection algorithm  -- to automatically (1)select (calculate) the leader-Validator from the list and (2)calculate the leader schedule from the list.

Importantly, as mentioned above, there is no problem to automatically exclude any Validator from the list -- if this Validator would just try doing something wrong -- and replace it with any other Validator from the waiting list of persons who are wanting to become Validators for getting the highly generous incentives.


## Decentralization which is sufficient

*For reference,

* about 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* about 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.*

The main principle of efficiency is that you must never do more than enough – and  exactly this way each efficient blockchain must work.

The hypothesis/idea is that

when the list of all current Validators are known (Solana's approach), and

when the list is limited to some number, and

when Validators are competing very hard for being in the list in order to be receiving the highly generous incentives, and

when any malicious Validator from the list cannot do anything wrong -- since it will be automatically dropped out of the list and replaced with a Validator from the waiting list,

then 100 truly-decentralized (truly-autonomous) Validators are the sufficient condition for a blockchain to be considered truly-decentralized and sustainable.

100 or 150, discussable.

This is the decentralization which is sufficient.

The approach allows truly-decentralized and truly-democratic blockchains to be extremely efficient.



## True Decentralization Being Highly Efficient

Even creating such very generous incentives for Validators ($5m annually per person), the total annual budget for 100 Validators, even at a very high level of the blockchain's market capitalization of, say, $5 trillion, might be just about $500 million -- which is just 0.05% of the blockchain's market capitalization.

*For reference,*

*During just one single year (2022), when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalizatin was a lot lower then $1 trillion, users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid the contributors (miners/validators), for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $6 billion.*

The question arises -- how much might the users of the Bitcoin blockchain pay to the contributors (miners/validators) annually when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalizatin (only theoretecally) would be $1 trillion.

**The Continuation**

<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1>9 &nbsp Contributors</h1>

On the Vote Blockchain, there are Contributors: Validator-Developers who are contributing in the Vote blockchain.

Each Contributor is a person (possibly anonymous) with their Public Address.

Any person is appointed to a position of Contributor by users (Voters) through Competitive Quadratic Voting.

The applicant (person), in order to prove their qualification and usefulness for the Vote blockchain and through this become Contributor, can use Hyde Park.

Contributors can recieve donations from users (Voters).




<h1>10 &nbsp Automated Donations</h1>

On the Vote Blockchain, there are Automated Donations for donating tokens to people who are contributing to the Vote blockchain.

Automated Donations are an element of a donation culture.

From the start, the monthly rate of Automated Donations is 0.05% from each public address's balance, and  the donors (Voters) can monthly change the rate by 5%  – either increase or decrease –  through Competitive Quadratic Voting. 



<h1>11 &nbsp Voting System</h1>

The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is as follows,

> **The more tokens are being locked for voting, the less tokens in real circulation.**

The Vote blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Competitive Quadratic Voting System (in-built)
* Hyde Park



<h1>12 &nbsp Competitive Quadratic Voting System</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, each voting on a proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots).

The "competitive" word means that on each proposal, the competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

> The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals.

For example, while voting on a proposal — fon appointing a certain person (Public Address) on the position of Contributor — some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The "quadratic" word, in its turn, means that the Voting Power of each bet is calculated as the square of the number of tokens.

For example, 

* if Voter’s bet is 1 Hand, the Voting Power of this bet is 1
* if Voter’s bet is 100 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 10
* if Voter’s bet is 1,000,000 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 1,000

and so on.

At the last slot (during each voting), the Voting Power of all the FOR bets are summarized and the Voting Power of all the AGAINST bets also are summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of at least 5% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 5%.

For example, if a vote on appointing a certain person (Public Address) to a position of Contributor has accumulated in total:

FOR: 210,000,000,000 Voting Power
AGAINST: 180,000,000,000 Voting Power

then,

the Voting Margin is 16.67%
(210,000,000,000 / 180,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67

and,

16.67% > 5%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 5%, the decision is made.



<h1>13 &nbsp Proposals</h1>

The Decisions are made on the following Proposals:

* on appointing a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of Contributor (100 positions)
* on dismissing a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor.
* on changing – either increasing or decreasing – the donation rate by 5%





<h1>14 &nbsp Hyde Park</h1>

Hyde Park is a set internet platforms for expressing various opinions and offering proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.
