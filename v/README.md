<h2 align="center">Brief Introduction</h2>


First of all, there is **$83 trillion** in the total global money supply, and this total supply is constantly increasing.

Definitely, in the inflationary monetary model â€” involving an endless increasing the total supply of the currency â€” there is nothing new and valuable. 

This conclusion comes from the fact that increasing the total supply of any currency **eventually always** results in the devaluation of the currency â€” meaning in decreasing the value of the unit of this currency. Never, in something different.

Fortunately, the crypto industry is trying to build the permissionless globally-transferable currencies (called tokens) with decreasing total-supply (Ethereum and Solana, to name a few) â€” with the perspective for each such a currency to become the most valuable asset in the financial world.

Unfortunately, all existing blockchains, being people's working systems, have **unsolvable fundamental** both technological and social problems (described below) which already now are preventing these blockchains from getting mass adoption, and which most likely will also do this in the future.

This paper proposes an idea (set of ideas / solutions / approaches) on a revolutionary blockchain protocol that solves **fundamental problems of the existing blockchains** and introduces the currency (token) with the powerfully-decreasing total-supply.

Precisely, **the permissionless, cheapest-to-globally-transfer token with the powerfully-increasing scarcity**.

The protocol is represented through describing the Unicorn (**U**) blockchain being built based on the given protocol.

Along with providing the innovative token, the U blockchain is much more efficient than  the most efficient  blockchains (for example, the Solana blockchain), using a new approach to consensus â€”called **Proof of Stake Flow** (PoSF).

Moreover, philosophy of the blockchain could be more suitable for the next generations, providing more democracy and more fairness, along with more suitability for upcoming creative economy.

The U blockchain could enable mass adoption for crypto in general, and be the 1st one to achieve the market capitalization of at least **$20 trillion**.

<h2 align="center">Abstract</h2>






### About Blockchain Technology

It seems like not everyone understands the main point of blockchain technology.

The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless ownership systems that are highly-sustainable â€“ meaning whose pre-programmed works are extremely-hard, at best impossible, to harm or stop.

Specifically, to build permissionless ownership systems about storing and transferring tokens (values).

The only way for a blockchain to be permissionless and highly-sustainable is to simultaneously, 

* use the public-private key pair authentication mechanism

* be a highly-decentralized system of many incentivized, autonomous nodes â€” where often each node is storing the same copy of the book of the blockchain.


Ideally, the nodes must be distributed across geographies and jurisdictions, so that the blockchain can remain permissionless and highly-sustainable even throughout any geopolitical events or natural disasters.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to really build/make such permissionless systems being highly-sustainable and plus, of course, as efficient as possible. 

Theoretically, a blockchain should be <b>as</b> efficient <b>as</b> possible â€” of course, remaining permissionless and highly-sustainable.

>**The main rule of efficiency of any working system is that the system must never do more than enough.**

*By the way, permissionlessness is just another word for censorship-resistance. And of course, permissionlessness and high-sustainability, both these ones together, imply trustlessness.*

Absolutely, blockchain technology causes a paradigm revolution. This is so because â€” to even mention just this single thing â€” no today's state would like to allow people to get permissionless access to value.




<br>


### About New Culture 

Additionally, thanks to blockchain technology, it will technically be impossible for creators to keep their **exclusive ownership** over created digitizable things (videos, audios, texts, programs) that become known.

This is so because technically, anyone can upload those known digitizable things on a blockchain, and then use them the way they want. 

For example, if the uploader wants, it can give permissionless access to those digitizable things to everyone, and no one on Earth ðŸŒŽ can forbid anyone to get this permissionless access to this all.

As they say â€” change or die.

Idea/Hypothesis

The idea/hypothesis is that due to this new creator-paradigm, we might shape a **Creator Thanksgiving Culture** to give thanks in tokens (donations) to creators of digitizable things. Also, through buying NFTs of the creators.

As an element of Creator Thanksgiving Culture, we might establish a new fete day â€” Creator Thanksgiving Day â€” say on December 30, where people from around the world might give their thanks in tokens (donations, gifts) to the most useful in-their-opinion people creating digitizable things (incl. ideas and code). Also, through buying NFTs of the creators.

Eventually, there might be people on social networks who are searching for creators eligible most for donations, making the lists.

In the future, in the creative economy, creators of digitizable things most likely will mainly monetize their works through donations â€” donations will play the most important role in monetization of creators of digitizable things.

The U blockchain is based exactly on donations (incl. automated-donations), and philosophy of this new culture in general.

We believe the new blockchain protocol is very (or even most) suitable for upcoming creative economy:

**Insight**:<br>
>**Hundreds of millions of people, having necessary funds, will always find a way to financially support several very useful-to-them people.**

Also,
>**Thousands of people, having necessary funds, will always find a way to financially support one very useful-to-them person.**

<br>

### *About Democracy*

"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter." 

Winston Churchillâ€™s quote sums up the mainstream opinion on what it means to have a real democracy, incl. direct democracy. 

The thing is that for a democracy to work well, those who are making the decisions, the average voters, need to 

1. have real power to change things

2. know what is going on

3. be really motivated.

On the other hand, absolutely, when you treat people like mushrooms â€” feed them manure and keep them in the dark â€” you get the "average voter" awful effect.

And, when people have real power and information, when they are motivated, when the system is transparent and on  blockchain, then there is a big chance we get a real democracy working well.

<br>

### About Immutability Of Code

This might seem that ideally, in the codebase of a blockchain, there should be no updates, and no variables that might be fine-tuned in order to change the way the blockchain works

In reality, total immutability of codebase is an impossible thing in the modern world since the blockchain inevitably risks becoming hopelessly obsolete, and also risks becoming extremely-vulnerable to possible code bugs.

So even Bitcoin's codebase is limitedly changeable â€” meaning, there is no total immutability, but only relative immutability â€” not to mention codebases of new blockÃ§hains.

By the way, total immutability is especially not good for codebases of smart-contracts being built on and sometimes connected to changeable blockchains since if any bug is discovered in the immutable code, it cannot be fixed and users can lose all of their funds. On the other hand, changeability of codebases of the smart-contract inevitably involves, among other things, a multi-signature of only a few people that, in turn, already causes another problems. So DeFi has to be done in a completely different way. 

As for codebase of a blockchain, the most right approach might be to provide fully-automated decentralization/democracy while realizing limited changeability of codebase â€” since total immutability of codebase is an impossible thing in the modern world.

So codebase (constitution) of a blockchain

* can have updates when these updates are accepted also in a fully-automated, highly-decentralized/democratic way

can have variables when values of these variables are changed only in a fully-automated, highly-decentralized/democratic way.

Ideally, a blockchain must be upgradable and fine-tunable in a highly-decentralized/democratic way.


<br>

### About 5 Fundamental Problems of All Current Blockchains

Below are **5** fundamental problems of all current blockchains compared with the Unicorn Blockchain.




<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

Fundamental Problem 1 is that people that build blockchains do it the same way as other people built states in the past: 

* with kings (founders), 
* with top servants (top contributors: top developers/validators/miners)
* often with royalty (VCs)
* but always with really-rightless people (users)

simultaneously saying that it is totally okay as it is now, or at best, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

The whole thing is that â€“ we can see this below â€“ only a highly-democratic blockchain is able to be highly-efficient, remaining highly-decentralized and highly-sustainable.

Ideally, blockchains must be highly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The U blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*

<i>
<b>
For reference
<br><br>
Technologically, making votings is the same as making transactions.
<br><br>
The Solana blockchain, at its best times, processed about 30 million transactions per day, at the peak, 65 million, and is already capable of over 400 million â€” with the potential to process 60 billion transactions per day in the future. So massive votings aren't any problem now in terms of technology.
<br><br>
Plus, Garbage-Collecting technologies help reduce the blockchain's storageÂ of no longer used/maintained data.

</b></i>



<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

Fundamental Problem 2 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there is the great unfairness â€” meaning, the most tokens of each blockchain are distributed to a small number of people.

*For reference,*

*Wealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than even in North Korea where the inequality Gini coefficient is **0.86** (it is 0.41 in the quite unequal US), the Gini coefficient for Bitcoin is, surprisingly to many, more terrible, an astonishing **0.88**.*

As Vitalik said about the great unfairness of Bitcoin â€” Was Bitcoin really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time <b>1/4</b> of the supply had already been handed out by the end of 2010?

Although nearly the same might be said about Ethereum â€” Was Ethereum really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time <b>1/2</b> of the supply had already been handed out among less than 7 thousand people by the end of 2014?

Another example, the SOL token â€” the Solana blockchain â€” entered the market only after multiple private rounds, and finally just 38% of the supply went to people (users).

On any other blockchain, token distribution and the inequality Gini coefficient aren't much better, if any better.

Probably, precisely the great unfairness and undemocratic nature (not technology that may be great) could **most** prevent each of the existing blockchains from getting mass adoption in the long run.

Ideally, a blockchain must execute very wide initial token-distribution, and have the best Gini coefficient in the industry.

The U blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*




<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

Fundamental Problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in transaction fees which, in turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that contributors (miners/validators) receive.

The current approach being **wrong** makes top-contributors (miners/validators) directly interested in congestions, meaning, in low bandwidth â€” and, in turn, not-interested in inceasing the bandwidth.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to increases in transaction fees, must never lead to increases in amounts of tokens that contributors (miners/validators) receive â€” instead, this whole token increase received must be burned.

The U blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*





<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

Fundamental Problem 4 is that for now, each of the existing blockchains is unable to start decreasing its native token's total supply.

For example, the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing its native token Bitcoin only at 2140 (in 118 years),  and will never start decreasing its native token's total supply.

Any other blockchain will at best start decreasing its native token's total supply maybe at one day in the future.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its native token's total supply from day one.

The U blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*





<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

Fundamental Problem 5 is that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

This problem comes from the fact that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one truly-decentralized way for a blockchain to achieve the "51% attack" resistance:

**the more the blockchain's market capitalization becomes the more of honest nodes must be added in the blockchain â€” in order for the blockchain to be considered sufficiently sustainable (secure).**.

According to this logic, a blockchain with a really huge market capitalization of say **$20 trillion** must always strive to have myriads of myriads of honest nodes in order to be considered highly-sustainable (secure).

At the same time, an increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's (shard's) bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, this approach means that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

Extremely importantly, increasing the number of nodes is just one of possible ways for a blockchain to achieve permissionlessness and high sustainability incl. the "51% attack" resistance.

Compared to other possible approaches, the "traditional" approach is much like adding to your car a 79th wheel, simultaneously dreaming about adding a 205th one.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, truly-decentralized, a lot more efficient way to achieve the "51% attack" resistance â€“ of course, remaining permissionless and highly-sustainable.

The U blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*










<p>&nbsp</p>





In fact, there are also another fundamental problems.


With all these fundamental problems, it is for sure that for now, the industry highly needs a new, innovative, driving-force blockchain in order to finally solve all these fundamental problems and for everything else to be built on it or with it taken into account. And it cannot already be the Bitcoin blockchain, or the Ethereum Blockchain, or any other blockchain you know (incl. Solana, Aptos, Sui, Worldcoin), it should be something fundamentally new â€” groundbreaking.

BLOCKCHAIN</h2>
<p align="center">In Brief </p>

<p align="left">

</p>

The U blockchain is a revolutionary, layer-1, DAO-style blockchain.

Technologically, the blockchain borrows heavily from **the Solana blockchain**.

From day one, the U blockchain is simultaneously:

* highly-decentralized
* highly-democratic (**new**)
* highly-sustainable 
* highly-efficient (**new**)
* with the bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS
* with the lowest transaction fees (**new**)
* with the native, powerfully-decreasing total-supply token (**new**)
* with over 100,000,000 owners of the native token (**new**)
* with the best Gini coefficient (**new**)

Some Notes

Importantly, from day one, the blockchain has over **100 million people** equally owning the blockchain's native token.

*There are ideas/solutions on how to absolutely-cheaply get over 100,000,000 unique people with their Public Addresses for the token airdrop, and on how about 2,000,000 of those people might become an especially-powerful driving-force of the blockchain.*

The high (even **extreme**) efficiency of the blockchain  is achieved througl the use of the new approach to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism â€” called **Proof-of-Stake-Flow** (PoSF).

Also from day one, the blockchain has as its native token **the permissionless, cheapest-to-globally-transfer token with the powerfully-increasing scarcity**. 

In other words, the permissionless, cheapest-to-globally-transfer token with the powerfully-decreasing total supply.

This all suddenly becames possible thanks to combining the following things,

* (1) the new approach to consensus (PoSF)
* (2) the full distribution of the **maximum supply** of the native token at the very beginning 
* (3) the use of the new **all-fees-burning** ðŸ”¥ mechanism
* (4) the introduction of the universal **tax** with a extremely-low rate supposed to additionally regularly be reduced.

Pay attention: all fees received (100% fees) are burned ðŸ”¥ and there is no emission of the native token any more after the Genesis Block. The maximum supply  is issued at the Genesis Block and then right away is fully distributed among over 100 million people.

Being especially-suitable for mass adoption, the blockchain might be the 1st one to achieve the market capitalization of at least **$20 trillion**, and allow at least **100,000,000 people** from around the world to make life-changing money from investing no money â€” plus, making **billions of people** also able to benefit from it.

Simultaneously, despite being highly-efficient, the blockchain **in a pre-programmed manner** strives to pay in the native token each Contributor (for example, being a software engineer) highly-generous **automated-donations**  â€” at least, **$1,2 million per year** or **$100,000 per month**.

The narrative defined by the blockchain involves the use of Soul-Bound Tokens (SBTs) and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technologies among other things â€” and plus, enables new culture which is being totally along with upcoming creative economy.

<p><b>Revolutionary, Layer-1, DAO-style Blockchain</b></p>
<b>FROM DAY ONE</b><br>

* highly-decentralized
* highly-democratic
* highly-sustainable
* highly-efficient
* with the bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS
* with the lowest transaction fees

* with the best Gini coefficient (**new**)

<p>&nbsp</p>



<h2>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h2>

The Vote token (**VTT**) is a native token of the U blockchain.

The Maximum Supply of the Vote token is created at the Genesis Block, and is 10,000,000 **VTT**.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 **Hands**.

The Hand (**Hand**) is the smallest unit of the Vote token.

After creating the Genesis Block, no printing of the Vote token is possible.


<br>

<h2>2 &nbsp Fair Full-Scale Distribution</h2>

After the creation of the Genesis Block, right away, through a fair airdrop, all 10,000,000 Vote tokens (100%) are distributed as follows, 

* 0.15% of VTT is distributed for free among 30 Contributors of the U DAO
* 99.85% of VTT is equally distributed for free among over **100,000,000 people** who become Voters (users).

Each Voter (user) receives about **0.1** VTT.

Each Contributor receives 5,000 times more VTT than the Voter â€” namely, **500** VTT. *More about the special role of Contributors below.*

This distribution mechanism provides the blockchain with an almost ideal Gini coefficient of nearly **0**.

The U blockchain has the best Gini coefficient in the industry from day one.

*As mentioned above, there are ideas/solutions on how to absolutely-cheaply get over 100,000,000 unique people with their Public Addresses for the token airdrop, and on how about 2,000,000 of those people might become an especially-powerful driving-force of the blockchain.* 

*Specifically these 2 given ideas/solutions will only be revealed to Contributors of the U DAO starting the Vote blockchain.*

<br>



<h2>3 &nbsp Over 50,000 TPS</h2>

From day one, the blockchainâ€™s bandwidth is over 50,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS), with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 

<br>



<h2>4 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h2>

Transaction Fees are paid by Account Owners to process transactions (instructions) on the blockchain.

Rental Fees are paid by Account Owners to keep accounts' data stored on the blockchain. 

Both Transaction Fees and Rental Fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).

All (100%) Transaction Fees and all (100%) Rental Fees paid are burned ðŸ”¥. 


<br>



<h2>5 &nbspVoting System</h2>


The U blockchain has a highly-decentralized governance.

This is a DAO-style blockchain leveraging all benefits and the best practices of DAOs.

The blockchainâ€™s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Competitive Voting (inbuilt)
* Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Non-Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Hyde Park
 
<br>

<h2>6 &nbsp Competitive Voting</h2>



On the U blockchain, each vote on each proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots, each Slot is 0.4 second).

And, there is a specific voting system: Competitive Voting.

The "competitive" word means that while voting on each proposal, competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

> <b>The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals</b>.

At the last Slot (during each voting), all votes are summarized â€” all "FOR" bets are summarized and all "AGAINST" bets are also summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of at least 15% â€“ in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 15%.

For example, if a vote on a certain proposal has accumulated in total:

* FOR: 3,500,000,000 Votes<br>

* AGAINST: 3,000,000,000 Votes

then,

<p>the Voting Margin is 16.67%<br>
(3,500,000,000 / 3,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67</p>

and,

16.67% > 15%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 15%, the decision is made.

Additionally, in order for a vote to be valid, it must meet the required 1% voter turnout.


<i><b>
The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is that the more tokens are being locked up for voting, the less tokens are in real circulation. Also importantly, Voters (users) lock up their tokens not in exchange for receiving rewards/interest.  

Even though not each Voter might vote, and plus, a Voter might spend only their idle time on voting, nevertheless at maximum, massive competitive-votings, happening on the U blockchain, might additionally decrease the Vote token's real circulating supply significantly â€” of course, resulting in an additional rise in the voting power of the Vote token.

<p>&nbsp</p>

**To be continued a bit below...**

<h1 align="center">Ideas/Hypotheses</h1>


<br>




## The New Approach to Consensus, PoSF

* A Lot of Room To Improve
* New Approach  or Extremely-Efficient Decentralization


## A Lot of Room To Improve


When we say about transaction fees, instead of taking into account only "**direct**" transaction fees, we should take into accoun the "**overall**" transaction fees**.

The overall transaction fees include â€” along with the "direct" transaction fees  â€” the "reward" transaction fees, the amounts of the native token that in reality users also pay to contributors (miners/validators) for each block.

It is so since all native tokens received by contributors (miners/validators) as rewards for blocks also enter the market and create the additional pressure on the native token price, decreasing the price of the native token and increasing in the same volume the real losses of users.

It is important to note, when any blockchain (Ethereum or Solana, for example) creates in the native token the inflation of, say, 4% yearly in order to pay rewards to contributors (miners/validators) â€” essentially, the protocol takes out from the balance of each user's account the **transaction fee**  or **tax** in the  same size of  4%, and gives it to the contributors â€” regardlessly if the user really made even any single  transaction during this year.



*For reference,*

*During just one single year (2022), when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalization was on average just about $575 billion, nevertheless, the users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid contributors (miners/validators) an amount exceeding $10 billion in total â€” as reward transaction fees (rewards for blocks) and direct transaction fees.*

This means that the annual costs are as big as 1.7% from the blockchain's market capitalization. Considering the extremely-low bandwidth of just 3-7 transactions per second, this is extremely-expensive.

<p><i>
Also, for reference,

* about 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* about 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.
</i></p>

As we can see, current decentralization isn't the one of a highly-high height but at the same time is extremely-expensive.

The thing is that we can achieve high decentralization and sustainability for extremely-low costs, providing the lowest overall transaction fees.




## New Approach or Extremely-Efficient Decentralization

This new approach allows us to achieve consensus highly efficiently.

Unlike the traditional approach to PoS, the new approach doesn't require stakes from Validators, and,  of course, doesn't require doing massive hash-works unlike PoW. 

Specifically in this paper as an example, the new approach uses Solana's Proof-Of-History mechanism and is much like Solana's PoS consensus mechanism â€” but again, consensus is happening without any stakes.

The whole trick is that this consensus might be efficiently used only by highly-decentralized and highly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the U blockchain is.


<p align="center"><b>For reference, How Solana Works</b></p>


At any given moment, the Solana blockchain (i.e. each node of the Solana blockchain called Validator) is storing the full list of all current working Validators. 

All the Validators being in the list should have the same hardware capabilities.

Each Validator is a person (possibly anonymous) running their Solana node and having their publicly-known Public Address. And exactly this Public Address serves to identify any given Validator in the list.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp List of All Validators:</p>


|    Stake    | Public Address of Validator|
| ----------- | ---------------------------|
|       1     |     banjo3banjo3banjo3ba   |
|       1     |     eag1eeag1eeag1eeag1e   |
|       1     |     zabu6zabu6zabu6zabu6   |
|       1     |     samurai4samurai4samu   |
|       1     |     venus7venus7venus7ve   |
|       1     |     montra8montra8montra   |
|       1     |     panda5panda5panda5pa   |
|       1     |     gex2gex2gex2gex2gex2   |


</p>

Also, time is splitted into Slots, each Slot is 0.4 second.

At any given Slot, in the list, there is only one Validator (called leader-Validator or Leader) which is creating the block.

Only the leader-Validator can create the block and stream it to other Validators.

All other Validators are only verifying the work of the leader-Validator, and then they send their successful verifications â€“ as their "For" votes â€“ back to the Leader.

In other words, all other Validators are voting â€“ each successful verification of the block by a Validator serves as one "For" vote for the consensus algorithm.

So the creation of the block by the leader-Validator and the verification of the block by other Validators are happening in parallel. This is a very good thing. And this becomes possible thanks to the Proof-Of-History mechanism which just helps replace the communication overhead with cheap local calculations. <i>If this last sentence isn't understandable, relax. Doesn't matter here.</i>

Each Validator is automatically appointed in the position of the Leader and then replaced with another Validator according to the Leader Schedule which is automatically calculated from the list by the stake-weighted selection algorithm.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Leader Schedule:</p>

|    Slot     | Public Address of Leader|
| ----------- | ------------------------|

The Leader Schedule is calculated far in advance of the slots it appoints Leaders in.

Importantly, at any given moment, there is the list of all working Validators, meaning any Validator being out of the list cannot be participating in the work and cannot be harming the consensus.

Plus, any Validator being in the list, just trying to do something wrong, will be punished by slashing its stake.

Technically, even 3 honest nodes (Validators) are enough for the Solana blockchain to function normally, incliding to maintain its normal bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS.

Idea/Hypothesis

The idea/hypothesis is that 

1. when a  list of all working Validators (possibly anonymous) is known (Solana's approach), and

2.  when the list is limited to 400 Validators, and

3. when each Validator is added in the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Voting), and

4. when each Validator in the list doesn't need to have any money/token and put it in the blockchain as their stake, and 

5. when each Validator in the list, being a software engineer, is receiving highly-generous Automated Donations â€” at least, **$1,2 million per year** or **$100,000 per month** â€” just for working honestly, and

6. when each Validator in the list is competing very hard with other Validators from the waiting list for being in the list in order to be receiving these highly generous Automated Donations, and

7. when any malicious Validator in the list, just trying to do something wrong, is automatically dropped from the list, and

8. when any suspicious Validator may also be dropped from the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Voting),

<b>then we might suppose there are very huge incentives for each Validator to work honestly,  and most likely the wide majority of (or even all) Validators in the list will work honestly.</b>


<b>
And we might, for example, just drop out the Solana's stake-weighted selection algorithm, used to automatically from the list calculate the Leader Schedule â€” and replace it with a random number selection algorithm to automatically from the list calculate the leader schedule, providing nearly the same time period in the position of the Leader to all Validators in the list.
</b>
<br><br>

Simply put, we give each Validator highly-generous incentives to work honestly and replace the automatic stake-slashing â€” in case the Validator tries doing something wrong â€” with the automatic dropping from the list.

It is the classic method of carrot and stick â€” used by every behavioral system.

**Old Approach**: Why would ever a Validator work honestly? It is because he/she is afraid of losing a small part of their stake â€” in the event of automatic stake-slashing. Greed-Driven Consensus.

**New Approach**: Why would ever a Validator work honestly? It is because he/she is afraid of losing a huge flow of tokens/stakes for years â€” in the event of automatic dropping from the list. Much bigger incentives to work honestly. Huge-Greed-Driven Consensus.<br><br>


**Old Approach:**<br>
Capital At Risk:<br>
A small part of stake, if any â€” or a small amount of reward<br>
**â€”â€”**<br>
**New Approach:**<br>
Capital At Risk:<br>
A huge flow of tokens/stakes for years<br><br>

Importantly, since even 3 honest nodes (Validators) are enough for such a Solana-type blockchain to function normally, incliding to maintain its normal bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS, then this over 133 fold margin of safety of 400 Validators (400/3=133.33) might be a sufficient condition for the blockchain to be considered sustainable.

Moreover, there are about 200 countries around the world. At best, from one single country, there might even be only 2 Validators â€” highly-autonomous Validators. Plus, Validators might be obligated to run their own nodes only on their own standalone rigs, not servers of server providers. And also, Validators might use not one but some validator-clients. This all would make the whole system highly-sustainable, meaning, extremely-hard, at best impossible, to harm or stop.

As a result, the blockchain might be highly (even extremely) efficient.

<i>If to suppose that such a blockchain's market capitalization would be $20 trillion, the overall yearly costs would in turn be extremely-low. Accounting for the high bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS, it might be hard to exactly calculate how many times this blockchain might be more efficient than, only theoretically, the Bitcoin blockchain at the same market capitalization, or the Ethereum blockchain, or even the Solana Blockchain.</i>

The new approach to consensus might be called **Proof-of-Stake-Flow** (PoSF).

So we can surely achieve high decentralization and sustainability for extremely-low costs, providing the lowest overall transaction fees.

**The Continuation**





<h2>7 &nbsp Contributors</h2>

Contributors are people who are allowed to be contributing to the U blockchain, and simultaneously who are supposed to be receiving highly-generous Automated Donations â€” at least, **$1,2 million per year** or **$100,000 per month**.

Each Contributor may only be contributing in the U blockchain in these two roles simultaneously: 

* as a Validator (node running)
* as a Developer (protocol maintenance and upgrades).

On the U Blockchain, there are the maximum number of positions of Contributor.

At the start, the maximum number is 400 and this number can yearly be changed â€” either increased or decreased â€” by 1% through democratic voting (Competitive Voting). *In order for a vote on the given proposal to be valid,  the vote must meet the required 20% voter turnout.*

Each Contributor is a person (possibly anonymous) with their Public Address.

Any person (Public Address) is appointed to the position of Contributor only by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Voting).

Each candidate/applicant for a position of Contributor have to find a way to prove their qualification and usefulness for the U blockchain in order to consequently become Contributor â€” optionally, using their Web3-native,decentralized identity (SBTs) to prove their qualificational/social graph in a privacy-preserving manner, and also using **Hyde Park**.

*Decentralized Identity (DI) combined with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technologies might  play an increasingly important role in Web3's evolution.*

At any moment, a person  (Public Address) being in the position of Contributor may be dropped from the position through democratic voting (Competitive Voting).

*The first 30 persons might be appointed to the positions of Contributor by an initiative group.*

*And, it might be a number of Contributors enough to start the U DAO starting, in turn, the U blockchain's blockchain, and to make the fair airdrop.*

*After the airdrop, it might be possible to form a full list of 400 Contributors through democratic voting (Competitive Voting).*

*The yearly planned Contributor-addition rate might be 30%. *

*It might take just 10 years to form a full list of 400 Contributors.*

<h2>8 &nbsp Automated Donations</h2>


<p align="center"><i>For reference, How Accounts Work On Solana</b></i>

Solanaâ€™s account model is much more complicated than, for example, the Ethereum's account model. 

On the Solana blockchain, accounts are much like files with additional features.

Accounts store their own states, incl. balances.

Accounts are held in validator memory and pay "rent" to stay there.

The security model enforces that an account's state can only be modified/controlled by a special inbuilt program â€” System Program.  The System Program has been built in Solana's codebase.

In other words, all accounts, by default, are owned by the special inbuilt program, the System Program, and only this special program is capable of modifying/controlling the account's state.

<br>

On the U Blockchain, there is a special type of account â€” Protocol&User Controlled Account (PUCA).

The state of such an account (PUCA) is modified/controlled by the two special inbuilt programs â€” System Program 1 and System Program 2.

System Program 1 is a special inbuilt code that modifies/controls the account's state. *It may be completely the same as Solana's System Program*.

System Program 2 is a special inbuilt code that modifies/controls the account's state only according to the Automated Donations Program â€” which, in turn, features the monthly rate of Automated Donations.

*Automated Donations are an element of a Creator Thanksgiving Culture, and also are an automated inbuilt feature of the U blockchain.*

At the start, according to the planed number of Contributors equal to 39 (30+9), the yearly rate of Automated Donations (**ADR** â€” Automated-Donations Rate) is **0.0975%** from each Public Address' balance, and the rate may yearly be changed â€” either increased or decreased â€” by *5%* through democratic voting (Competitive Voting). 

All Automated Donations for vacant positions are burned ðŸ”¥. 

It is important to remind, when any blockchain (Ethereum or Solana, for example) creates in the native token the inflation of, say, 4% yearly in order to pay rewards to contributors (miners/validators) â€” essentially, the protocol takes out from the balance of each user's account the **transaction fee**  or **tax** in the  same size of  4%, and gives it to the contributors â€” regardlessly if the user really made even any single  transaction during this year.


*Some number of positions of Contributor might be taken by specific persons or working groups (Public Addresses with multi-signatures) in order for the blockchain to fund and fulfill specific tasks assosiated with some public/common goods,*

* funding coordinating protocol maintenance and upgrades, incl. funding additional external developers and auditors to test and find exploit
* funding documentation and research.

*Treasury funds may also be formed up the same way.*



<br>

# To All Contributors 

In general, it is supposed that Contributors of the Initiative Group become Contributors of the U DAO. In turn, Contributors of the U DAO become Contributors of the U blockchain â€” first become Contributors of the testnet and then automatically, Contributors of the mainnet.

*For reference*

*The Bitcoin blockchain achieved the market capitalization of $50 billion in 104 months after the launch.*

*The Solana blockchain, on a bull market, achieved the market capitalization of $50 billion in 11 months after the launch.*

Now, generally, a blockchain with at least some innovative idea is accumulating attention and capitalization very fast. 

The U blockchain unprecedentedly has a lot of innovative ideas, surpassing all other blockchains in each key aspect. 

Plus, the U blockchain unprecedentedly starts with over $100 000,000 people equally owning the blockchain's native token.

Our vision is that our 3rd milestone is the blockchain's market capitalization of $20 trillion â€” where the 1st milestone is $50 billion, and 2nd milestone is $1 trillion.

From the very beginning â€” from the start of the U DAO â€” each Contributor receives highly-generous Automated-Donations in the native token of the U blockchain, about $100,000 per month.

There is a special mechanism (needs to first be implemented) in order for Contributors of the U DAO to, in a pre-programmed manner, be receiving Automated-Donations in the native token of the U blockchain.

On the initial stage, the native token is estimated based at the 1st milestone, the market capitalization of $50 billion.

Below is the table of VTT received by each Contributor per year in total, splitted by years.

<br>

**Table of Automated Donations (AD) Received by each Contributor by Year**

29|	15|	0.0007|	0.17|	400|
30|	15|	0.0006|	0.15|	400|



From the table above, we can see that 

* at the start of the 1st year, CUT of TAX is 0% â€” the tax rate remains 0.0975%
* during the 1st year each Contributor receives 250 VTT in total

* at the start of the 2nd year, CUT of TAX is 70% â€” the tax rate becomes 0.0380%
* during the 2nd year each Contributor receives 75 VTT in total

* at the start of the 3rd year, CUT of TAX is 56% â€” the tax rate becomes 0.0218%
* during the 3rd year each Contributor receives 33 VTT in total

and so on.

Last but not Least 

The stake of each Voter â€” after the airdrop â€” is about 0.1 VTT.

Our vision is that at the 3rd milestone, this stake will be  about $200,000 which is considered life-changing money.

0.1 VTT â€”> $200,000  at the 3rd milestone 

Just keep in mind that during only the first 3 years â€” 2 years in the U DAO and 1 year in the U blockchain  â€” the total amount of VTT tokens received by each Contributor will be 750 VTT which is 7,500 times more than that life-changing money of 0.1 VTT.

750 VTT â€”> $1,500,000,000 at the the 3rd milestone 


And, the 3 fundamental insights are the following,

* there is no way for VTT but to go up because VTT is the token with strong fundamentals and with the powerfully-increasing scarcity

* there is no top to Unicorn ðŸ¦„ VTT because there is no bottom for fiat money

* a hundred million people or even hundreds of millions of people will always find a way to financially support 400 useful people.


The U DAO is being formed right now.

Being a software engineer, you may become a Contributor of the U DAO.

<h2>9 &nbsp Voting Proposals</h2>

On the U blockchain, there are Automatic Proposals and Non-Automatic Proposals.

Automatic Proposals happen each 365 days and are the following ones:

* proposal to change â€“ either increase or decrease â€“ the monthly rate of Automated Donations by 5%
* proposal to change â€“ either increase or decrease â€“ the maximum number of the positions of Contributors by 0.1%

Non-Automatic Proposals may start at any moment (Slot) and are the following ones:

* proposal to appoint a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of Contributor
* proposal to dismiss a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor





<br>
<h2>10 &nbsp Hyde Park</h2>

Hyde Park is a set of internet sites and protocols (incl. Vote.Governance.Forum, Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Nostr) that might be used for expressing various opinions and discussing proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.

**To be continued a bit below...**

<h1 align="center">Idea/Hypothesis</h1>


# About Technologies

On the table, there already are good blockchain technologies to use.

Idea/Hypothesis

The idea/hypothesis is that we might take some existing blockchain technologies â€” some of the most advanced blockchain technologies â€” and combine them.

For example, we might take core code of the Solana blockchain as our codebase and combine it with code of some dApps on the Solana blockchain â€” of course, modifying this all a bit.



<p>&nbsp</p>

**The Continuation**


<h2>11 &nbsp Technologies & Creator Thanksgiving Culture</h2>

From day one, the U blockchain leverages the most advanced of cutting edge blockchain technologies.

Technologically, the blockchain borrows heavily from **the Solana blockchain**.











<br><br><br>
## Addition

* *About Nakamoto Coefficient*
* *About Bitcoin*


### *About Nakamoto Coefficient*

For now, the industry highly needs a new universal coefficient that describes the minimum amount of effort it would take to disrupt any given blockchain. 

The Nakamoto coefficient is not good for this since it is one-sided â€” doesn't comprehensively take into account the main point of blockchain technology.

As a result, the Nakamoto coefficient doesn't take into account all possible decentralized ways for a blockchain to achieve permissionlessness and high sustainability incl. the "51% attack" resistance.








### *About Bitcoin*

Of course, Bitcoin is special.

Some even believe Bitcoin has its value because they think Bitcoin is lots of lots of pure energy converted into a digital monetary instrument via the mining process. But in reality, inefficient (expensive) consensus does never add value to a blockchain because inefficient  consensus does never increase the consumer value of the blockchain.

Instead, the customer value of a blockchain only relies on how big are problems that the blockchain solves, and how small are flaws the blockchain has.

For example, the Bitcoin blockchain, for now, is both permissionless and highly-sustainable, and it gets totally along with the main point of blockchain technology.

But, as mentioned above, Bitcoin for now isn't and a lot of time further also won't be really a fixed-supply token because the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at 2140 (in 118 years).

More importantly, absolutely, Bitcoin doesn't have any pre-programmed decreasing of total-supply.

Also, Bitcoin's codebase doesn't have total immutability but only relative immutability â€” in other words, is limitedly-changeable which, in turn, doesn't make the Bitcoin blockchain unique or better than others in terms of immutability of codebase.

Plus, the Bitcoin blockchain has all those other unsolvable, unstoppable fundamental problems (flaws), including the absolutely-terrible Gini and extreme inefficiency â€” including, in turn, extremaly-low bandwidth.

The allegedly incredibly-promising Lightning, conceived to solve the problem of extremely-low bandwidth, requires the regular user to either run a lightning node or trust the one who is running a lightning node, which respectively either won't work with the regular user  or â€” according to the main point of blockchain technology â€” is absurd.

By the way, additionally, most bitcoin trading takes place on centralized exchanges, which makes this all â€” according to the main point of blockchain technology â€” also absurd.


Forecast

Bitcoin might have been the leader until some moment. For example, until there is a better token â€” a token with a fundamentally better tokenomics (with pre-programmed decreasing of supply, big user base, the ideal Gini), and which is fundamentally much better in many other key aspects.

Over time, the whole point of Bitcoin as a blockchain, thanks to its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, might be more clear and more about the same point that, for example, a Leonardo da Vinci's painting or a set of NFTs of a unique art collection has, and which is the flexing â€” the ultimate way for people to flex.

<i><b>Flexing as a culture, in a broad sense, might be described as showing that you are better than other people since you have the thing other people cannot have or don't understand the need to have. For example, this may happen through spending significant money on a unique thing (token) proving your involvement with some unique (sometimes historical) event. Essentially, this is a way for anyone to demonstrate their domination, superiority. This is such public relations â€” this is about the status. And plus, of course, this does not exclude making money through reselling the unique thing (token) to another one.</b></i>

So, the whole value of Bitcoin as a blockchain â€” if compared to new, more advanced blockchains going to come â€” might be more about its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, meaning Bitcoin tokens might be much like NFTs.

Already now, Bitcoin tokens aren't really fungible: each Bitcoin has its history, story and fate, meaning, its price â€” for example, more clean Bitcoins have more prices. Over time, this point might become even more clear to everyone â€” earlier Bitcoins might also have more prices.

The word's top universities like Stanford, Harvard or Oxford might buy earlier Bitcoin tokens as NFTs â€” along with their purchase of other NFTs  â€” to prove their status: their domination and superiority in understanding innovations.


To Bitcoin Maximalists

Of course, in society there is inertia and you can console yourself with the network effect and Lindy effect.

But by believing that the Bitcoin blockchain will forever be the most successful one in the crypto industry, you deny the ability of our civilization to progress.

Remember Nokia with one billion customers, history for decades, and the question in Forbes â€” CAN ANYONE CATCH THE CELL PHONE KING?

</p>



# CONCLUSION

As mentioned above, there are even more problems being fundamental than described here.

Importantly, each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve the fundamental problems.

All the fundamental problems of the blockchain industry can be solved only by highly-decentralized and highly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the U blockchain is.

Of course, it is just a matter of time that some initiative group of people will create a blockchain of that sort.

<p>&nbsp</p>


*Additionally, there is a lot of other ideas â€” incl. ideas about DeFi in general, plus specifically, about stablecoins, exchanges, bridges, and also about tokenized commits (tokenized code).*

The Initiative Group, up to 30 people, is being formed right now to start the U DAO on the Solana blockchain.
