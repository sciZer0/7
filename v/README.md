# Our Fundamentals

Every code created must be open and free.<br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

And of course, we should be forming a Creator Donation Culture for giving thanks in tokens to creators of ideas and code.<br>

When people create something not good enough, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it – to improve it.

 
<p>&nbsp</p>
 <h1 align="center">THE VOTE BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
 
<p>&nbsp</p>
 <h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>

The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless ownership systems being sustainable – meaning, whose pre-programmed works are extremely hard, at best impossible, to stop.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to build these systems as fast and efficient as possible.

This paper proposes an idea of a new blockchain, specifically, the fast blockchain which is simultaneously:

* extremely-decentralized
* extremely-democratic
* extremely-sustainable
* extremely-efficient

and also, additionally, is able of other unbelievably-great things, impossible for regular blockchains.



 <p>&nbsp</p>
 
<h1 align="center">Five Problems of Current Blockchains</h1>

<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

The problem 1 is that we (people) build blockchains the same way as we built states: 

with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

Ideally, blockchains must to be truly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

**For reference, Solana's routine – on its best times – was about 30 million transactions per day. At the peak, 65 million. So a massive voting (by, say, 1 million voters) isn't any problem now in terms of technology.**


<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

The problem 2 is the inability of each of the existing blockchains to truly start decreasing its Circulating Supply.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.


<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

The problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in gas prices which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in gas prices, must never lead to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive — instead, this whole token increase received must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

The problem 4 is that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one truly-decentralized way for a blockchain to build up its "51% attack" resistance:

**to more and more increase a number of honest nodes in the blockchain**.

At the same time, such an increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, this approach means that increasing overhead (efficiency) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, more efficient, truly-decentralized way to build up its "51% attack" resistance – of course, remaining truly-decentralized and truly-democratic.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.



<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

The problem 5 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for validators and developers if calculated per person.

Ideally, a blockchain must create highly generous incentives for validators and developers when calculated per person — in order to be a more sustainable working system.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p align="center">
Actually, there are many more problems.
</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p align="center">
And, each blockchain<br>
existing in 2023 is fundamentally<br>
unable to solve these problems.<br>

**Motto: Like Others Just Better**



<h1>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h1>

Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.



<h1>2 &nbsp Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution</h1>

The whole Maximum Supply (10,000,000 Vote tokens) is created at the Genesis Block.

And right away, through a fair airdrop, all the 10,000,000 Vote tokens (100%) for free are equally distributed among 1,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting.



<h1>3 &nbsp 50,000 TPS</h1>

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 



<h1>4 &nbsp Free Transactions</h1>

There are no Gas fees for simple transactions, meaning, it is a freemium model blockchain.

A simple transaction is a transaction performing a transfer of tokens from one address not associated with a smart contract to another address also not associated with a smart contract.

<i><b>
Simply put, this includes, among other cases, that each transfer of tokens from one regular user to another is for free and that each transfer of tokens involving a smart contract will be with a Gas fee.
<br><br>
An user, if there is a congestion (if any), may set a fee for their simple transaction, meaning, only at its worst the Vote blockchain might take fees for simple transactions – while each of the existing blockchains always does it -- because any transactions without fees aren't possible on regular blockchains.
<br><br>
Possible DDoS/Spam attacks, due to the fact that all simple transactions are free and hence can be created in enormous amounts, are beaten the same way as it is already done by all top blockchains in relation to other possible DDoS/Spam attacks that can, endlessly and frequently, be requesting the Block Height, for example.
</b></i>


<h1>5 &nbsp Gas Fees</h1>

Users pay Gas Fees only for some sorts of transactions.

Specifically, an user pays a Gas fee for deploying a smart contract and for making a transaction involving a smart contract.

Gas Fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).





<h1>6 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h1>

From day one, all Gas fees, received on each block, are burned, resulting in a decrease of the Vote token's Circulating Supply.

<i><b>
Decreasing Circulating Supply is the impossible thing for each of the existing blockchains.

This is even better than if there were the Everyday Halving of the block reaward in the Bitcoin Blockchain — since in the Vote blockchain, there is Decreasing Circulating Supply, not Increasing Circulating Supply.

At best, such an extremely deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of the Vote Token over time.</b></i>


<h1>7 &nbsp Voting System</h1>

The blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Automatic & Non-Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Competitive Quadratic Voting (inbuilt)
* Hyde Park
 
<i><b>
The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is that the more tokens are being locked for voting, the less tokens in real circulation.
 
From day one, on the Vote blockchain, there are 1,000,000 Voters and a lot of Automatic and Non-Automatic Proposals to vote. 
 
Importantly, even though the main principle of democracy is that there is absolute freedom for each Voter to either vote or not vote, and everyone might spend only their idle time on voting.
 
Nevertheless, at best, massive competitive-votes, happening on the Vote blockchain, might be additionally decreasing the Vote token's real circulation a lot.

<p>&nbsp</p>

**To be continued a bit below...**



<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>

* A Lot of Room To Improve
* New Approach to Consensus or Highly Efficient True-Decentralization


## A Lot of Room To Improve


*For reference,*

*During just one single year (2022), when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalization was on average just about $576 billion, nevertheless, the users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid the miners/validators, for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $10 billion.*

This means that the annual costs are as big as 1.7% from the blockchain's market capitalization. It is extremely expensive.

<p><i>
Also, for reference,

* about 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* about 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.
</i></p>

As we can see, current true-decentralization isn't the one of the extremely high level but at the same time is extremely expensive.

The whole thing is that we can reach true-decentralization of the extremely high level and for the extremely low costs simultaneously.




## New Approach to Consensus or Highly Efficient True-Decentralization

This new approach allows to reach consensus highly efficiently.

The approach doesn't require stakes from Validators (unlike POS) and of course doesn't require doing massive hash-works (unlike POW). 

At the same time, the approach includes the Solana's Proof-Of-History mechanism — but again, in the  whole, the consensus is happening without stakes.

The whole trick is that this approach might be efficiently used only by truly-decentralized and truly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.


<p align="center"><b>For reference, about Solana</b></p>


At any given moment, the Solana blockchain is storing the full list of all current Validators. 

All the Validators being in the list should have the same hardware capabilities.

Each Validator is a person (possibly anonymous) with their publicly-known Public Address, and exactly this Public Address serves to identify any given Validator in the list.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Full List of All Current Validators:</p>


|    Stake    | Public Address of Validator|
| ----------- | ---------------------------|
|       1     |     Pumbaaxk3Q32fg1n5zet   |
|       1     |     EagLe1j3rg9y3h5kh8rl   |
|       1     |     Zazuph19rg463k9dkn2a   |
|       1     |     Jaqee3hm8fy6fG1n9kes   |
|       1     |     Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       1     |     Scrat3hk23v5fD3a9dut   |
|       1     |     Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       1     |     Vixeyygfpsdkfse59hde   |

</p>

Also, time is splitted into Slots, each Slot is 400 milliseconds.

At any given Slot, in the list, there is only one Validator (called leader-Validator or Leader) which is creating the block.

Only the leader-Validator can create the block and stream it to other Validators.

All other Validators are only verifying the work of the leader-Validator, and then they send their successful verifications back to the Leader.

In other words, all other Validators are voting – each successful verification of the block by a Validator serves as one vote for the consensus algorithm.

So the creation of the block by the Leader and the verification of the block by other Validators are happening in parallel. This is a very good thing. And this becomes possible thanks to the Proof-Of-History mechanism which just helps replace the communication overhead with cheap local calculations. <i>If this last sentence isn't understandable, relax. Doesn't matter here.</i>

Each leader-Validator is automatically selected (calculated) from the list by a stake-weighted selection algorithm and then is automatically rotated with another Validator in the list according to the leader schedule also calculated automatically by the stake-weighted selection algorithm.

<b>Leader Schedule:</b>

|    Slot     | Public Address of Leader|
| ----------- | ------------------------|
|       1     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       2     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       3     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       4     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       5     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       6     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       7     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       8     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |


Importantly, at any given moment, there is the list of all working Validators, meaning, any Validator being out of the list cannot be participating in the work and cannot be harming the consensus.

Plus, any Validator being in the list, just trying to do something wrong, will be punished by slashing its stake – and, theoretically, might be dropped out of the list.

Hypothesis/Idea

The hypothesis/idea is that 

* when the list of all current Validators (possibly anonymous) are known (Solana's approach), and

* when the list is limited to 150 Validators, and

* when each Validator is added in the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting), and

* when each Validator in the list doesn't need to have any money and put it as the stake, and 

* when each Validator in the list is receiving the highly generous Automated Donations (~ <b>$3 million annually</b>) just for working honestly, and

* when each Validator in the list is competing very hard with other Validators from the waiting list for being in the list in order to be receiving these highly generous Automated Donations, and

* when any malicious Validator in the list, just trying to do something wrong, is automatically dropped out of the list and replaced with a Validator from the waiting list, and

* when any suspicious Validator may also be dropped out of the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting),

* <b>then we might consider there is very huge incentives for each Validator to work honestly</b>, and 

* <b>then the wide majority of (or even all) Validators in the list will work honestly</b>, 
<b>
and we might, for example, just drop out the Solana's stake-weighted selection algorithm, used to automatically (1)select (calculate) the leader-Validator from the list and (2)calculate the leader schedule from the list, and replace it with a random number selection algorithm — to automatically (1)select (calculate) the leader-Validator from the list and (2)calculate the leader schedule from the list.
</b>
<br><br>

<i>
There are about 150 countries around the world. At best, from one single country, there might even be just 1 Validator — truly-autonomous Validator — and this would make the whole system extremely sustandable, meaning, extremely hard, at best impossible, to stop.
</i>
<br><br>
These 150 truly-decentralized (truly-autonomous) Validators – which are highly motivated to work honestly and which are selected through democratic voting – might be  the sufficient condition for a blockchain to be considered truly-decentralized and sustanable.
<br><br>
Such 150 Validators might be enough and to spare.
<br><br>
As a result, the blockchain might be more than <b>170 times (16,800.00%)</b> more efficient than the Bitcoin blockchain.
<br><br>


> <p>&nbsp &nbsp More than <b>170 times (16,800.00%) more efficient than the Bitcoin blockchain</b>

 
<br>
So we can surely reach true-decentralization of the extremely high level and for the extremely low costs simultaneously. 
<br><br>


<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>






**The Continuation**

<h1>8 &nbsp Contributors</h1>

Contributors are people who may be contributing in the Vote blockchain.

At the start, on the Vote Blockchain, there are 150 positions of Contributors.

Each Contributor is a person (possibly anonymous) with their Public Address.

Each Contributor, in equal size - if compared to other Contributors, receives the highly generous Automated Donations (~ $3 million annually) from Voters.

Each Contributor may only be contributing in the Vote blockchain in these two roles simultaneously: 

* as Validator, and 
* as Developer.

Any person (Public Address) is appointed to the position of Contributor only by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).

Each applicant must find a way to prove their qualification/usefulness for the Vote blockchain in order to become Validator, and can use Hyde Park.

Each person  (Public Address) being in the position of Contributor may be dropped out of the position by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).

*The very first 15 persons are appointed to the positions of Contributor by an initiative group.*






<h1>9 &nbsp Automated Donations</h1>

Automated Donations are an element of a Creator Donation Culture.

On the Vote Blockchain, there are Automated Donations for donating tokens to Contributors.

Automated Donations are an automated inbuilt feature of the Vote blockchain.

At the start, the monthly rate of Automated Donations is 0.05% from each public address' balance, and the donors (Voters) can monthly change the rate by 5%  – either increase or decrease –  through Competitive Quadratic Voting.






<h1>10 &nbsp Competitive Quadratic Voting</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there is Competitive Quadratic Voting, a specific voting system.

Each voting on a proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots, each Slot is 0.4 second).

The "competitive" word means that on each proposal, competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

> The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals.

For example, while voting on a proposal — on appointing a certain person (Public Address) to the position of Contributor — some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The "quadratic" word, in its turn, means that the Voting Power of each bet is calculated as a square root of the number of tokens.

For example, 

* if Voter’s bet is 1 Hand, the Voting Power of this bet is 1
* if Voter’s bet is 100 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 10
* if Voter’s bet is 1,000,000 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 1,000

and so on.

At the last Slot (during each voting), the Voting Power of all the FOR bets are summarized and the Voting Power of all the AGAINST bets are also summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of at least 15% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 15%.

For example, if a vote on a certain proposal has accumulated in total:

* FOR: 3,500,000,000 Voting Power<br>

* AGAINST: 3,000,000,000 Voting Power

then,

<p>the Voting Margin is 16.67%  &nbsp (3,500,000,000 / 3,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67</p>

and,

16.67% > 15%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 15%, the decision is made.


<h1>11 &nbsp Proposals</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there are Automatic and Non-Automatic Proposals.

Automatic Proposals happen each 30 days and are the following ones:

* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the monthly rate of Automated Donations by 5%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the maximum number of the positions of Validator by 0.1%.

Non-Automatic Proposals may start at any moment (Slot) and are the following ones:

* proposal to appoint a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of Contributor
* proposal to dismiss a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor






<h1>12 &nbsp Hyde Park</h1>

Hyde Park is a set internet platforms (incl. Twitter, Telegram, Descord, Vote) for expressing various opinions and offering proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>


# About Technologies

Thanks to good people, on the table, there already are good technologies to use.

The hypothesis/idea is that we might take some existing blockchain technologies — some of the most advanced blockchain technologies — and combine them.

For example, we might take code of Solana blockchain itself as codebase and combine it with code of some apps on the Solana blockchain, of course, modifying them a bit.


<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

**The Continuation**

<p>&nbsp</p>
<h1>13 &nbsp Technologies & Creator Donation Culture</h1>

From day one, the Vote blockchain uses the most advanced blockchain technologies.

As an element of a Creator Donation Culture, we establish a new fete day — Creator Thanksgiving Day — on December 30th where people around the world may give their credits (thanks) to the most useful in-their-opinion creators of ideas and code through direct donations of tokens. 

<i>
Eventually, there might (will inevitably) be people who are searching for the creators eligible for donations, making the lists. 
<br><br>
One of the first names of such lists might be Anatoly Yakovenko.
</i>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>


The main point of Bitcoin, absolutely  is not sound money — since the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at  the year 2140 (in 118 years).

The whole point of Bitcoin as a blockchain, thanks to its uniqueness, is the same one the Mona Lisa has, which is the flexing — the ultimate way to flex. 

But, even though the Mona Lisa is relatively expensive, it will never cost $20 trillion or more — and also, the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalization will never be $20 trillion or more.

Eventually, people will understand it.

On the other hand, all other blockchain don't  even have this "Mona Lisa" point.

And ...

As mentioned above, actually, in the industry, there are even many more problems than described here, and each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve these problems.

And, for this reason,  each blockchain existing in 2023 (excl. Bitcoin) deserves to go away.

All the problems can be solved only by truly-decentralized and truly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.
