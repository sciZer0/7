# Our Fundamentals

<p>
<b>
Every code created must be open source.<br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

And of course, we should be forming a donation culture for giving thanks in tokens to the creators of ideas and code.<br>

When people create something not good enough, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it — to improve it.<br>

<h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>

The main point of blockchain technology is to just build a permissionless system whose pre-programmed work is extremely hard – implying, impossible  – to stop.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to build such an unstoppable permissionless system which is, simultaneously, maximally efficient.

But not everyone in the industry understands the main point of blockchain technology and the main task of developers.



<h1 align="center">Big Problems of Current Blockchains</h1>

<h3 align="center">Big Problem 0</h3>

The big problem 0 is that we (people) build blockchains the same way as we built states: with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

Ideally, exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*For example, on its best times, Solana's regular day was about 30 million transactions per day. At the peak, 65 million. So massive voting by,  say,  1 million voters won't be any problem now in terms of technology.*


<h3 align="center">Big Problem 1</h3>

The big problem 1 is the inability of each of the existing blockchains to start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

Even this single problem along negatively affects each project's economy a lot and is SO important that might be considered as the sufficient condition for canceling each of the existing blockchains.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.


<h3 align="center">Big Problem 2</h3>

The big problem 2 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in gas prices which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in the total amount of money that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in gas prices, must never lead to an increase in the total amount of money that the servants (miners/validators) receive -- instead, this whole token increase must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.


<h3 align="center">Big Problem 3</h3>

The big problem 3 is that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that only one single way is for a blockchain to build up its "51% attack" resistance:

**the more nodes in a network, the more resilient this network is to a 51% attack.**

Despite the fact that the increase in the number of nodes doesn’t increase the network's bandwidth, each blockchain nevertheless strives to increase the number of nodes in the network in order to be more resilient to a 51% attack -- inevitably increasing thereby the total amount of money that users must pay the servants (miners/validators) during each day.

*For example, the Solana blockchain or Bitcoin blockchain  –   if,  only theoretically, each of them would reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion – each of them would never allow its users to pay their servants (miners/validators) in total just about say $500,000,000 a year or less, while the Vote blockchain can do it, remaining truly-decentralized and truly-democratic.*

*In 2022, even when the Bitcoin blockchain market capitalization was a lot lower than $1 trillion, the total amount of money that users paid their servants (miners/validators) was over $6 billions.*

The traditional approach  inevitably  results in the fact that each of the existing blockchains must always strive to have lots of lots of profitable nodes in order to be more resilient to a 51% attack -- meaning, each of the existing blockchains must always strive to be more expensive for users.

Of course, undoubtedly, the traditional approach is a dead end approach.

For now, increasing overhead (inefficiency) is the target for each of the existing blockchains.

Importantly, each of the existing blockchains is inefficient by design, meaning, doomed by design.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, more efficient way to build up its "51% attack" resistance, remaining truly-decentralized and truly-democratic.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.


<h3 align="center">Big Problem 4</h3>

The big problem 4 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for validators and developers if calculated per person.

Ideally, a blockchain must create very generous incentives for validators and developers when calculated per person.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

**Motto: Like Bitcoin Just Better**


# Maximum Supply

Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.

# 1 Million Users, Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution

At the start, through a fair airdrop, all 100% of Vote tokens are equally distributed among 1,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

# 50,000 TPS

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 

# Free Transactions

There are no Gas fees for simple transactions, meaning, it is a freemium model blockchain.

A simple transaction is a transaction performing a transfer of tokens from one address not associated with a smart contract to another address also not associated with a smart contract.

Simply put, this includes, among other cases, that each transfer of tokens from one regular user to another is for free and that each transfer of tokens involving a smart contract will be with a Gas fee.

*An user, if there is congestion (if ever), may set a Gas fee for their simple transaction, meaning, only at its worst the Vote blockchain might take Gas fees for simple transactions – while each of the existing blockchains always does it -- because any transactions without Gas fees aren't possible on regular blockchains.*

# Possible DDoS/Spam Attacks

Possible DDoS/Spam attacks, due to the fact that all simple transactions are free and hence can be created in enormous amounts, are beaten the same way as it is already done in relation to other possible DDoS/Spam attacks that can, for example, be requesting the Block Height.

# Gas Fees

Users pay Gas Fees only for some sorts of transactions.

Specifically, users pay Gas fees for deploying smart contracts and for making transactions with smart contracts.

Gas fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).

# Order of Transactions in Each Block

During each 400-millisecond slot, from the transactions received, the ordered list of transactions (maximum 20,000) is automatically formed in the following order:

1. transactions with Gas are automatically ordered in descending order of Gas

2. transactions without Gas are automatically ordered with a random number algorithm.

If the total amount of all transactions, received but yet not executed, is bigger than the maximum block size (20,000 transactions) – the remaining transactions will participate in competition during the next slot, according to the same order described above.

This approach makes an unfair extracting of value by miners (so-called MEV) more difficult.



# Decreasing Circulating Supply

From the start, all Gas fees, received during each slot, are burned, resulting in decreasing the Circulating Supply of Vote token.

This is for the first time ever, unique in the industry, that decreasing Circulating Supply starts from day one.

At best, such an extremely deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of Vote Token over time.
