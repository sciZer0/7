# Our Fundamentals

Every code created must be open source.<br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

And of course, we should be forming a donation culture for giving thanks in tokens to the creators of ideas and code.<br>

When people create something not good enough, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it — to improve it.
 
 


<h1 align="center">5 Problems of Current Blockchains</h1>

<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

The problem 1 is that we (people) build blockchains the same way as we built states: with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

Ideally, blockchains must to be truly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*For example, on its best times, Solana's regular day was about 30 million transactions per day. At the peak, 65 million. So massive voting by, say, 1 million voters isn't any problem now in terms of technology.*


<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

The problem 2 is the inability of each of the existing blockchains to start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.


<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

The problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in gas prices which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in gas prices, must never lead to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive — instead, this whole token increase must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

The problem 4 is that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one single way  for a blockchain to build up its "51% attack" resistance:

**the more nodes in a blockchain, the more resilient this blockchain is to a 51% attack.**

At the same time, the increase in a number of nodes in a blockchain doesn't increase the blockchain's bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, such a way means that increasing overhead (efficiency) is the target for each of the existing blockchains.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, more efficient way to build up its "51% attack" resistance, remaining truly-decentralized and truly-democratic.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

The problem 5 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for validators and developers if calculated per person.

Ideally, a blockchain must create very generous incentives for validators and developers when calculated per person.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

**Motto: Like Others Just Better**


# Maximum Supply

Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.

# 1 Million Users, Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution

At the start, through a fair airdrop,  Maximum Supply — all 100% of Vote tokens — is equally distributed among 1,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting.

# 50,000 TPS

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 

# Free Transactions

There are no Gas fees for simple transactions, meaning, it is a freemium model blockchain.

A simple transaction is a transaction performing a transfer of tokens from one address not associated with a smart contract to another address also not associated with a smart contract.

Simply put, this includes, among other cases, that each transfer of tokens from one regular user to another is for free and that each transfer of tokens involving a smart contract will be with a Gas fee.

*An user, if there is congestion (if ever), may set a Gas fee for their simple transaction, meaning, only at its worst the Vote blockchain might take Gas fees for simple transactions – while each of the existing blockchains always does it -- because any transactions without Gas fees aren't possible on regular blockchains.*

# Possible DDoS/Spam Attacks

Possible DDoS/Spam attacks, due to the fact that all simple transactions are free and hence can be created in enormous amounts, are beaten the same way as it is already done in relation to other possible DDoS/Spam attacks that can, for example, be requesting the Block Height.

# Gas Fees

Users pay Gas Fees only for some sorts of transactions.

Specifically, an user pays a Gas fee for deploying a smart contract and for making a transaction involving a smart contract.

Gas fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).

# Order of Transactions in Each Block

During each 400-millisecond slot, from the transactions received but yet not executed, the ordered list of transactions (maximum 20,000) is automatically formed in the following order:

1. transactions with Gas fees are automatically ordered in descending order of Gas

2. simple transactions without Gas fees are automatically ordered with a random number algorithm.

If the total amount of all transactions, received but yet not executed, is bigger than the maximum block size (20,000 transactions) – the remaining transactions will participate in competition during the next slot, according to the same order described above.

This approach greatly reduces an extraction of value done by miners (so-called MEV) on AMM exchanges, and plus, of course, complitelly excludes this phenomenon on order-book exchanges.



# Decreasing Circulating Supply

From the start, all Gas fees, received on each block, are burned, resulting in a decrease of  the Vote token's Circulating Supply.

At best, such an extremely deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of Vote Token over time.




<h1 align="center">Hypothesis</h1>

For reference,

For just one single year (2022), users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid their servants (miners/validators), for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $6,000,000,000.

Also for reference, 

* 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.

The hypothesis is that 100 truly-decentralized (truly-autonomous) validators, which are constantly rotated by users and competing for their positions very hard, are the sufficient condition for a blockchain to be considered truly-decentralized.

100 or 150, discussable.

On the Vote blockchain, there are always about 100 truly-decentralized (truly-autonomous) validators which are constantly rotated by users and competing for their positions very hard.

As a total result, the Vote blockchain from day one:

* is with 50,000 TPS
* is truly-decentralized<br>
* is truly-democratic<br>
* can afford very generous incentives for validators and developers when calculated per person<br>
* can afford Decreasing Circulating Supply<br>
* can afford free transactions<br>
* is highly resilient to a 51% attack<br>
* has High Partition Tolerance<br>
* has the ability to restore to 100 or more truly-decentralized validators<br>
* is highly efficient<br>



# Tax

On the Vote Blockchain, there is a tax, the Governance Token Tax (GTT) being charged automatically and monthly.

From the start, the rate of the GTT is 0.05% on each account's balance and then Voters can change it monthly – either increase or decrease – by 5% through Competitive Quadratic Voting. 


# Voting System

The blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Competitive Quadratic Voting System (in-built)
* Hyde Park


# Competitive Quadratic Voting

The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is as follows below.

> **The more tokens are being locked for voting, the less tokens in real circulation.**

On the Vote blockchain, voting on each proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots).

The “competitive” word means that on each proposal, the competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals.

For example, while voting on a proposal — for example, on appointing a certain person (Public Address) on the position of Validator-Developer — some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The “quadratic” word, in its turn, means that the Voting Power of each bet is calculated as the square of the number of tokens.

For example, 

* if Voter’s bet is 1 Hand, the Voting Power of this bet is 1
* if Voter’s bet is 100 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 10
* if Voter’s bet is 1,000,000 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 1,000

and so on.

At the last slot (during each voting), all the Voting Power of the FOR bets are summarized and all the Voting Power of the AGAINST bets also are summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of 5% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 5%.

For example, if a vote on appointing a certain person (Public Address) on the position of Validator-Developer has accumulated in total:

for: 210,000,000,000 Voting Power
against: 180,000,000,000 Voting Power

then,

the Voting Margin is 16.67%
(210,000,000,000 / 180,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67

16.67% > 5%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 5%, the decision is made.

# Proposals

The Decisions are made on the following Proposals:

* on appointing a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of the Validator-Developer (100 positions)
* on dismissing a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of the Validator-Developer.
* on changing – either increasing or decreasing – the rate of the GTT by 5% 


The Appointing/Dismissing Proposal is just a specific Public Address (the public key of a keypair) which is associated with a certain person (possibly anonymous), relying on the person’s declaring.
