# Our Fundamentals

Every code created must be open source.<br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

And of course, we should be forming a donation culture for giving thanks in tokens to the creators of ideas and code.<br>

When people create something not good enough, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it — to improve it.

 <h1 align="center">THE VOTE BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
 
<p>&nbsp</p>
 <h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>

The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless systems whose pre-programmed works are extremely hard – at best, impossible  – to stop.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to build the unstoppable permissionless systems which are,  simultaneously, as fast and efficient as possible.

 

<h1 align="center">5 Problems of Current Blockchains</h1>

<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

The problem 1 is that we (people) build blockchains the same way as we built states: with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

Ideally, blockchains must to be truly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*For example, on its best times, Solana's regular day was about 30 million transactions per day. At the peak, 65 million. So massive voting by, say, 1 million voters isn't any problem now in terms of technology.*


<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

The problem 2 is the inability of each of the existing blockchains to really start decreasing its Circulating Supply.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.


<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

The problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in gas prices which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in gas prices, must never lead to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive — instead, this whole token increase must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

The problem 4 is that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one single way  for a blockchain to build up its "51% attack" resistance:

**the more nodes in a blockchain, the more resilient this blockchain is to a 51% attack.**

At the same time, the increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, such a way means that increasing overhead (efficiency) is the target for each of the existing blockchains.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, more efficient way to build up its "51% attack" resistance, remaining truly-decentralized and truly-democratic.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

The problem 5 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for validators and developers if calculated per person.

Ideally, a blockchain must create very generous incentives for validators and developers when calculated per person -- in order to be a more sustainable working system.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

**Motto: Like Others Just Better**



<h1>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h1>

Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.



<h1>2 &nbsp Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution</h1>

At the start, through a fair airdrop, 100% of Vote tokens for free are equally distributed among 1,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting.



<h1>3 &nbsp 50,000 TPS</h1>

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 



<h1>4 &nbsp Free Transactions</h1>

There are no Gas fees for simple transactions, meaning, it is a freemium model blockchain.

A simple transaction is a transaction performing a transfer of tokens from one address not associated with a smart contract to another address also not associated with a smart contract.

Simply put, this includes, among other cases, that each transfer of tokens from one regular user to another is for free and that each transfer of tokens involving a smart contract will be with a Gas fee.

*An user, if there is congestion (if ever), may set a Gas fee for their simple transaction, meaning, only at its worst the Vote blockchain might take Gas fees for simple transactions – while each of the existing blockchains always does it -- because any transactions without Gas fees aren't possible on regular blockchains.*



<h1>5 &nbsp Possible DDoS/Spam Attacks</h1>

Possible DDoS/Spam attacks, due to the fact that all simple transactions are free and hence can be created in enormous amounts, are beaten the same way as it is already done in relation to other possible DDoS/Spam attacks that can, for example, be requesting the Block Height.



<h1>6 &nbsp Gas Fees</h1>

Users pay Gas Fees only for some sorts of transactions.

Specifically, an user pays a Gas fee for deploying a smart contract and for making a transaction involving a smart contract.

Gas fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).


<h1>7 &nbsp Order of Transactions in Each Block</h1>

During each 400-millisecond slot, from the transactions received but yet not executed, the ordered list of transactions (maximum 20,000) is automatically formed in the following order:

1. transactions with Gas fees are automatically ordered in descending order of Gas

2. simple transactions without Gas fees are automatically ordered with a random number algorithm.

If the total amount of all transactions, received but yet not executed, is bigger than the maximum block size (20,000 transactions) – the remaining transactions will participate in competition during the next slot, according to the same order described above.

This approach greatly reduces an extraction of value done by miners (so-called MEV) on AMM exchanges, and plus, of course, complitelly excludes this phenomenon on order-book exchanges.



<h1>8 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h1>

From the start, all Gas fees, received on each block, are burned, resulting in a decrease of  the Vote token's Circulating Supply.

At best, such an extremely deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of Vote Token over time.




<h1 align="center">Hypothesis</h1>

For reference,

For just one single year (2022), users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid their contributors (miners/validators), for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $6,000,000,000.

Also for reference, 

* 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.

The hypothesis is that 100 truly-decentralized (truly-autonomous) validators, which are constantly rotated by users and competing for their positions very hard, are the sufficient condition for a blockchain to be considered truly-decentralized and sustainable.

100 or 150, discussable.



<h1>9 &nbsp Sustainability & Efficiency</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there are always about 100 truly-decentralized (truly-autonomous) validators, each of which is constantly competing for their position very hard because they may either be recieving very generous donations from Voters (users) – up to $5 million annually per person — or may be replaced with a new validator, by Voters (users).

> Generous donations:<br>
> Up to $5 million annually per person.

The total donation budget, even at its maximum, is just about $500 million, regardless of the increase in the blockchain's market capitalization.



<h1>10 &nbsp Automated Donations</h1>

On the Vote Blockchain, there are Automated Donations for donating tokens to people who are contributing to the Vote blockchain.

Automated Donations are an element of a donation culture.

From the start, the monthly rate of Automated Donations is 0.05% from each account's balance and  the donors (Voters) can monthly change the rate by 5%  – either increase or decrease –  through Competitive Quadratic Voting. 



<h1>11 &nbsp Voting System</h1>

The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is as follows,

> **The more tokens are being locked for voting, the less tokens in real circulation.**

The Vote blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Competitive Quadratic Voting System (in-built)
* Hyde Park



<h1>12 &nbsp Competitive Quadratic Voting System</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, each voting on a proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots).

The "competitive" word means that on each proposal, the competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals.

For example, while voting on a proposal — for example, on appointing a certain person (Public Address) on the position of Validator-Developer — some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The "quadratic" word, in its turn, means that the Voting Power of each bet is calculated as the square of the number of tokens.

For example, 

* if Voter’s bet is 1 Hand, the Voting Power of this bet is 1
* if Voter’s bet is 100 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 10
* if Voter’s bet is 1,000,000 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 1,000

and so on.

At the last slot (during each voting), all the Voting Power of the FOR bets are summarized and all the Voting Power of the AGAINST bets also are summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of 5% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 5%.

For example, if a vote on appointing a certain person (Public Address) on the position of Validator-Developer has accumulated in total:

for: 210,000,000,000 Voting Power
against: 180,000,000,000 Voting Power

then,

the Voting Margin is 16.67%
(210,000,000,000 / 180,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67

16.67% > 5%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 5%, the decision is made.



<h1>13 &nbsp Proposals</h1>

The Decisions are made on the following Proposals:

* on appointing a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of the Validator-Developer (100 positions)
* on dismissing a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of the Validator-Developer.
* on changing – either increasing or decreasing – the rate of the GTT by 5% 

The Appointing/Dismissing Proposal is just a specific Public Address (the public key of a keypair) which is associated with a certain person (possibly anonymous), relying on the person’s declaring. 

The applicant (person) in order to prove their qualification and usefulness for the Vote blockchain, can use Hyde Park.



<h1>14 &nbsp Hyde Park</h1>

Hyde Park is a set internet platforms for expressing various opinions and offering proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.
