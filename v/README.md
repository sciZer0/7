ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

<p align="right">
Probably<br>
each of blockchains existing on 2023<br>
deserves to go away<br>

<p><b>
Every code created must be open source.<br><br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other peopleâ€™s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

And of course, we should be forming a donation culture for giving thanks in tokens to the creators of ideas and code.<br>

When people create something not good enough, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it -- to improve it.<br>
