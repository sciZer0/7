<b>About the Vote Blockchain</b>

This paper proposes an idea about a next-gen, layer 1, DAO-style blockchain which from day one is simultaneously:

* highly-decentralized
* highly-democratic
* highly-sustainable
* highly-efficient
* with over 50,000 TPS
* with a native, decreasing-supply token
* with the ideal Gini coefficient
* with the ideal stablecoin
* with over 10 million users

All of it, including high (even extreme) efficiency, is possible thanks, among other things, to the use of a new consensus mechanism.




<b>About Blockchain Technology</b>

The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless ownership systems that are highly-sustainable – meaning, whose pre-programmed works are extremely-hard, at best impossible, to harm or stop.

Specifically, permissionless ownership systems about storing and transferring tokens (values).

The only way for a blockchain to be permissionless and highly-sustainable is to simultaneously (1)use the public-private key pair authentication mechanism and (2)be a people-ruled, highly-decentralized system of nodes  – without being under control of any single entity.

Ideally, nodes must be distributed across geographies and jurisdictions, so that the blockchain can remain permissionless and highly-sustainable even throughout geopolitical events or natural disasters.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to really build/make such permissionless systems highly sustainable, decentralized, scalable, fast, reliable, secure — and plus, of course, as efficient as possible. 

Each blockchain must be AS efficient AS possible — of course, remaining permissionless and highly-sustainable.

And, THE rule of efficiency is that you must never do more than enough.


*By the way, permissionlessness is just another word for censorship-resistance, and of course, permissionlessness and sustainability, both these ones together, imply trustlessness.*

*And also of course, blockchain technology causes a paradigm revolution because no today's state would like to allow people to get permissionless access to value.*



<b>About Today's States</b>

Gensler says that every blockchain token other than bitcoin is securities because you can find a website, you can find a group of entrepreneurs, and finally, there’s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.

But, according to Gensler's logic, the Bitcoin token is also securites because you can find a website, you can find a group of entrepreneurs, and finally, there’s a group in the middle (core devs and miners) and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.

The only reason that Gensler puts the Bitcoin blockchain out the range is that — and this lies beyond justice and legality — he thinks he cannot harm the Bitcoin blockchain.

The Gensler & Co's rule in reality is that if we think we can harm a blockchain, if needed, we will.

Each of the wide majority of today's states is anti-people and, to one or another degree, a despotic regime repressing opportunities of people and wanting to only strengthen its power — its control over people. COVID, financial crisis, and coming CBDC are just some of powerful tools for these states to do this all.

Politicians are just actors playing their roles in a play called "Democracy" and pretending they want to improve people's lives.

The mainstream "left"/"right" choice between 2 political buttons — the "people" button (blue) and the "businesses" button (red) — is a false choice, enforced choice.

With blockchain technology, we can create outstandingly good conditions for both people and businesses simultaneously.



# About New Culture

Additionally, thanks to blockchain technology, it will technically be impossible for creators to keep their exclusive ownership over created digitizable things that become known — because technically, anyone can upload these same numbers (digitizable things — videos, aidios, texts, programs) on a blockchain and then use them the way they want. If the uploader wants — no one can forbid anyone to get permissionless access to this all.

As they say — change or die.

We should form a Creator Thanksgiving Culture to give thanks in tokens (donations) to creators of digitizable things. Also, through buying NFTs of the creators. *More on this below.*

From this new vision, in particular, each code or idea that becomes known must be free. *The code in the crypto industry, in the vast majority, is already open and free.*

Including, everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.

Also, when someone creates something new and digitizable which eventually becomes known, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it — to improve it — on their own.

*Importantly, people and businesses will never stop or slow down creating/inventing new digitizable things even that become instantly known because there is a strong first mover advantage.*



<b>About Immutability</b>

This might seem that ideally, in codebase of a blockchain, there should be no variables that might be adjusted and no updates that might be made in order to change the way the blockchain works.

In reality, total immutability of codebase is an impossible thing in the modern world since the blockchain inevitably risks becoming hopelessly obsolete. So even Bitcoin's codebase is limitedly changeable — meaning, there is no total immutability, but only relative immutability — not to mention codebases of new blockçhains.

By the way, total immutability is especially not good for codebases of smart-contracts being built on and sometimes connected to changeable blockchains since if any bug is discovered in the immutable code, it cannot be fixed and users can lose all of their funds. On the other hand, changeability of codebases of the smart-contract inevitably involves, among other things, a multi-signature of only few people that, in turn, already causes another problems. *A bit more on problems of smart-contracts and solutions below.*

As for codebase of a blockchain, the most right approach might be to provide fully-automated, high decentralization/democracy when realizing limited changeability of codebase — since total immutability of codebase is an impossible thing in the modern world.

So codebase (constitution) of a blockchain can have variables when values of these variables are changed only in a fully-automated, highly-decentralized/democratic way — and can have updates when these updates are accepted also in a fully-automated, highly-decentralized/democratic way.



<b>About the Greatest Values</b>

In Inflationary Economy, there is nothing new and valuable.

All that Inflationary Economy (endless emissions of regular tokens) can finally give us is devaluations of tokens (values).

On the other hand, the Bitcoin token is allegedly considered a non-inflationary token — a fixed-supply token. But in reality, the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at 2140 (in 118 years).

Moreover, the greatest values in the Universe are not the fixed-supply tokens, but the decreasing-supply tokens.

A decreasing-supply, permissionless, decentralized token with its own dedicated blockchain is the thing that our civilization has never known before and fundamentally is much better than "digital gold" or "ultra sound money".



<b>About Fundamental Problems of All Current Blockchains</b>

Below are 7 fundamental problems of all current blockchains compared to the Vote Blockchain.

<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

Fundamental Problem 1 is that we people build blockchains the same way as we built states: 

with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

The whole thing is that *– we can see this below –* only a highly-democratic blockchain is able to be highly-efficient – plus, remaining highly-decentralized and highly-sustainable.

Ideally, blockchains must be highly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*

<i>
<b>
For reference, the Solana blockchain, in its best times, processed about 30 million transactions per day, at the peak, 65 million, and is already capable of over 400 million per day — with the potential to process 60 billion transactions per day in the future. So massive daily votes (by, say, even 50 million voters) aren't any problem now in terms of technology.
</b></i>



<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

Fundamental Problem 2 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there is the inequality – great inequality.

*For reference,*

*Wealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than in North Korea where the inequality Gini coefficient is 0.86 (it is 0.41 in the quite unequal US): the Gini coefficient for Bitcoin is an ASTONISHING 0.88.*

As Vitalik said about the absolutely-terrible Gini of Bitcoin — Was Bitcoin really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time 1/4 of the supply had already been handed out by the end of 2010?

Although nearly the same might be said about Ethereum — Was Ethereum really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time 1/2 of the supply had already been handed out among less than 7 thousand people by the end of 2014?

Another example, SOL tokens — the Solana blockchain — entered the market only after multiple private rounds, and finally just 38% of the total initial token supply went to the community.

The inequality Gini coefficient of any other of the existing blockchains isn't much better, if any better.

Ideally, a blockchain must have the ideal Gini coefficient of 0 from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*




<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

Fundamental Problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in transaction fees which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in transaction fees, must never lead to an increase in the amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive — instead, this whole token increase received must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*








<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

Fundamental Problem 4 is that each of the existing blockchains is fundamentally unable to start decreasing its native token's Circulating Supply.

For example, the Bitcoin blockchain will stop its printing only at 2140 (in 118 years), and the Ethereum blockchain – maybe at one day in the future. At the same time, no one of them or other existing blockchains is able to start decreasing its native token's Circulating Supply.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its native token's Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*





<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

Fundamental Problem 5 is that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

This problem comes from the fact that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one truly-decentralized way for a blockchain to achieve the "51% attack" resistance:

**the more the blockchain's market capitalization becomes the more nodes must be added in the blockchain — in order for the blockchain to be considered sufficiently sustainable (secure).**.

According to this logic, a blockchain with a really huge market capitalization must always strive to have lots of lots of honest nodes.

At the same time, an increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's (or shard's) bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, this approach means that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

Extremely importantly, the number of nodes is just one of tools for a blockchain to achieve permissionlessness and high sustainability including the "51% attack" resistance.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, truly-decentralized, more efficient way to achieve the "51% attack" resistance – of course, remaining permissionless and highly-sustainable.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*




<h3 align="center">Problem 6</h3>

Fundamental Problem 6 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for its validators and developers if calculated per person — meaning unclear prospects for the blockchain's sustainability and software development.

Ideally, a blockchain must always create highly-generous incentives for its validators and developers when calculated per person — in order to be a more sustainable working system and have strong grounds for software development in the long term.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*




<h3 align="center">Problem 7</h3>

Fundamental Problem 7 is that each of the existing blockchain is fundamentally unable to create the ideal stablecoin — a really decentralized, permissionless, trustless, ultra-stable and importantly, safe stablecoin — meaning, among other things, which never relies on banks and never relies on multi-signatures of only few people that can (often does) result in losing funds of users.

Without the ideal stablecoin, plus having all these fundamental problems above, getting adoption for crypto in general is extremely-hard.

Ideally, a blockchain must have the ideal stablecoin from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*



<p>&nbsp</p>


In fact, there are also another fundamental problems.

And, each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve the fundamental problems.

With all these fundamental problems that cannot be solved by EACH of the existing blockchains, it is for sure that for now, the industry highly needs a new, innovative, driving-force blockchain in order to finally solve all these problems and for everything else to be built on it or with it taken into account. And it cannot already be the Bitcoin blockchain or the Ethereum Blockchain or any other blockchain you know, it should be something fundamentally new —  groundbreaking.

</p>

<p><b>Next-Gen, Layer 1, DAO-style Blockchain</b></p>
<b>FROM DAY ONE</b><br>

* highly-decentralized
* highly-democratic
* highly-sustainable
* highly-efficient
* with over 50,000 TPS
* with a native, decreasing-supply token
* with the ideal Gini coefficient
* with the ideal stablecoin
* with over 10 million users
<p>&nbsp</p>



<h1>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h1>

Vote (VOTE) is a native token of the Vote blockchain.

The Maximum Supply of the Vote token is created at the Genesis Block.

The Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.

After creating the Genesis Block, no printing of the Vote token is possible.




<h1>2 &nbsp Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution</h1>

After creating the Genesis Block right away, through a fair airdrop, all the 10,000,000 Vote tokens (100%) are for free equally distributed among over 10 million people becoming Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting, I have an idea on this.



<h1>3 &nbsp Over 50,000 TPS</h1>

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is over 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 




<h1>4 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h1>

Gas Fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).

All gas fees paid (100%) are burned. 

This results in decreasing the Vote token's Circulating Supply from day one.

<i><b>
Decreasing Circulating Supply is the impossible thing for each of the existing blockchains.

At best, such a highly-deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of the Vote Token over time.</b></i>




<h1>5 &nbspVoting System</h1>


The Vote blockchain has an highly-decentralized governance and operates based on direct vote by token holders. 

This is a DAO-style blockchain leveraging all benefits and all the best practices of DAOs.

The blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Non-Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Competitive Quadratic Voting (inbuilt)
* Hyde Park
 
<i><b>
The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is that the more tokens are being locked up for voting, the less tokens are in real circulation — importantly, Voters (users) lock up their tokens not in exchange for receiving rewards/interest.  

From day one, on the Vote blockchain, there are over 10 million Voters and a lot of Automatic and Non-Automatic Proposals to vote For or Against. 
 
Importantly, even though not each Voter might vote, and plus, a Voter might spend only their idle time on voting, nevertheless at best, massive competitive-votings, happening on the Vote blockchain, might additionally decrease the Vote token's real circulating supply significantly — of course, resulting in an additional rise in the voting power of the Vote token.

<p>&nbsp</p>

**To be continued a bit below...**



<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>

* A Lot of Room To Improve
* New Consensus Mechanism or Extremely Efficient True-Decentralization


## A Lot of Room To Improve


*For reference,*

*During just one single year (2022), when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalization was on average just about $575 billion, nevertheless, the users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid the miners/validators, for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $10 billion — as rewards for blocks and transaction fees.*

This means that the annual costs are as big as 1.7% from the blockchain's market capitalization. It is highly expensive.

<p><i>
Also, for reference,

* about 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* about 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.
</i></p>

As we can see, current decentralization isn't the one of an highly-high level but at the same time is highly expensive.

The thing is that we can achieve high decentralization and sustainability for extremely-low costs.




## New Consensus Mechanism or Extremely Efficient True-Decentralization

This new consensus mechanism allows us to achieve consensus highly efficiently.

The new consensus doesn't require stakes from Validators (unlike POS) and,  of course, doesn't require doing massive hash-works (unlike POW). 

At the same time, the new consensus mechanism uses Solana's Proof-Of-History mechanism and is much like Solana's POS consensus mechanism — but again, consensus is happening without any stakes.

The whole trick is that this consensus might be efficiently used only by highly-decentralized and highly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.


<p align="center"><b>For reference, How Solana Works</b></p>


At any given moment, the Solana blockchain (i.e. each node of the Solana blockchain called Validator) is storing the full list of all current working Validators. 

All the Validators being in the list should have the same hardware capabilities.

Each Validator is a person (possibly anonymous) running their Solana node and having their publicly-known Public Address. And exactly this Public Address serves to identify any given Validator in the list.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Full List of All Current Validators:</p>


|    Stake    | Public Address of Validator|
| ----------- | ---------------------------|
|       1     |     pumbaaxk3q32fg1n5zet   |
|       1     |     eag1e1j3rg9y3h5kh8rl   |
|       1     |     zazuph19rg463k9dkn2a   |
|       1     |     jaqee3hm8fy6fg1n9kes   |
|       1     |     ninja1b7mg8y3h9kh82n   |
|       1     |     scrat3hk23v5fd3a9dut   |
|       1     |     panda3hk8f56js1n9zet   |
|       1     |     vixeyygfpsdkfse59hde   |


</p>

Also, time is splitted into Slots, each Slot is 400 milliseconds.

At any given Slot, in the list, there is only one Validator (called leader-Validator or Leader) which is creating the block.

Only the leader-Validator can create the block and stream it to other Validators.

All other Validators are only verifying the work of the leader-Validator, and then they send their successful verifications – as their "For" votes – back to the Leader.

In other words, all other Validators are voting – each successful verification of the block by a Validator serves as one "For" vote for the consensus algorithm.

So the creation of the block by the Leader and the verification of the block by other Validators are happening in parallel. This is a very good thing. And this becomes possible thanks to the Proof-Of-History mechanism which just helps replace the communication overhead with cheap local calculations. <i>If this last sentence isn't understandable, relax. Doesn't matter here.</i>

Each Validator is automatically appointed in the position of the Leader and then replaced with another Validator according to the Leader Schedule which is automatically calculated from the list by the stake-weighted selection algorithm.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Leader Schedule:</p>

|    Slot     | Public Address of Leader|
| ----------- | ------------------------|
|       1     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       2     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       3     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       4     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       5     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       6     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       7     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       8     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |


Importantly, at any given moment, there is the list of all working Validators, meaning, any Validator being out of the list cannot be participating in the work and cannot be harming the consensus.

Plus, any Validator being in the list, just trying to do something wrong, will be punished by slashing its stake – and, theoretically, might be dropped out of the list.

Technically, even 3 honest nodes (Validators) are enough for the Solana blockchain to function normally, maintaining the bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS.

Hypothesis/Idea

The hypothesis/idea is that 

1. when the list of all working Validators (possibly anonymous) is known (Solana's approach), and

2.  when the list is limited to 250 Validators, and

3. when each Validator is added in the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting), and

4. when each Validator in the list doesn't need to have any money/token and put it in the blockchain as their stake, and 

5. when each Validator in the list, being a programming engineer, is receiving highly-generous Automated Donations (~ <b>$2 million per year</b>) just for working honestly, and

6. when each Validator in the list is competing very hard with other Validators from the waiting list for being in the list in order to be receiving these highly generous Automated Donations, and

7. when any malicious Validator in the list, just trying to do something wrong, is automatically dropped out of the list, and

8. when any suspicious Validator may also be dropped out of the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting),

<b>then we might suppose there are very huge incentives for each Validator to work honestly and most likely the wide majority of (or even all) Validators in the list will work honestly.</b>


<b>
And we might, for example, just drop out the Solana's stake-weighted selection algorithm, used to automatically from the list calculate the Leader Schedule — and replace it with a random number selection algorithm to automatically from the list calculate the leader schedule, providing the same time period in the position of the Leader to all Validators in the list.
</b>
<br><br>

Simply put, we give each Validator highly-generous incentives to work honestly and replace the automatic stake-slashing — in case the Validator tries doing something wrong — with the automatic dropping-out from the list.

POS Consensus: Why would ever a Validator work honestly? It is because he/she is afraid of losing a small part of their stake — in the event of automatic stake-slashing. Greed-Driven Consensus.

New Consensus: Why would ever a Validator work honestly? It is because he/she is afraid of losing a huge flow of tokens/stakes for years — in the event of automatic dropping-out from the list. A lot bigger incentives to work honestly. Huge-Greed-Driven Consensus.<br><br>


**Old Consensus:**<br>
**Proof Of Stake**<br>
**(POS)**<br>
Capital At Risk:<br>
A small part of stake, if any — or a small amount of reward<br>
**——**<br>
**New Consensus:**<br>
**Proof Of Stake Flow**<br>
**(POSF)**<br>
Capital At Risk:<br>
A huge flow of stakes/tokens for years<br><br>

Importantly, even 3 honest nodes (Validators) are enough for such a Solana-type blockchain to function normally, maintaining the bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS. So this over 83 fold margin of safety (of 250 Validators, 250/3=83.33) might be  the sufficient condition for the blockchain to be considered sustainable.

Moreover, there are about 200 countries around the world. At best, from one single country, there might even be just 1 Validator — highly-autonomous Validator. Plus, Validators might be obligated to run their nodes only on separate rigs, not servers of server providers. And plus, Validators might use not one but some validator-clients. This all would make the whole system highly-sustainable, meaning, extremely-hard, at best impossible, to harm or stop.

As a result, the blockchain might be highly (even extremely) efficient.

<i>If to suppose that such a blockchain's market capitalization would be $20 trillion, the overall yearly costs would still be just the same $500 million (2*250=500). Accounting for a high bandwidth of over 50.000 TPS, it might be hard to calculate how many times this blockchain might be more efficient than, only theoretically, the Bitcoin blockchain at the same market capitalization or even the Solana Blockchain.</i>


So we can surely achieve high decentralization and sustainability for extremely-low costs.

**The Continuation**

<h1>6 &nbsp Contributors</h1>

Contributors are people who may be contributing to the Vote blockchain and receiving daily the highly generous Automated Donations — <b>in total ~ $3 million per year per person</b> — from Voters.

Each Contributor may only be contributing in the Vote blockchain in these two roles simultaneously: 

* as a Validator (node running)
* as a Developer (protocol maintenance and upgrades).

On the Vote Blockchain, there are the maximum number of positions of Contributor.

At the start, the maximum number is 250 (positions) and this number can be changed through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).

Each Contributor is a person (possibly anonymous) with their Public Address.

Any person (Public Address) is appointed to the position of Contributor only by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).

Each candidate/applicant for a position of Contributor must find a way to prove their qualification and usefulness for the Vote blockchain in order to become Contributor and for this can use <b>Hyde Park</b>.

At any moment, a person  (Public Address) being in the position of Contributor may be dropped out of the position by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).


*Some additional number of positions of Contributor might be taken by specific people (taken by Public Addresses with multi-signatures) for funding some public/common goods,*

* funding coordinating protocol maintenance and upgrades, incl. funding additional external developers and auditors to test and find exploit
* funding documentation and research.

*The first 30 persons might be appointed to the positions of Contributor by an initiative group. And it might be an enough number to start the blockchain  and make the fair airdrop, and after which, it might be possible to form a full list of 150 Contributors along the way — through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).*




<h1>7 &nbsp Automated Donations</h1>

Automated Donations are an element of a Creator Donation Culture.

On the Vote Blockchain, there are Automated Donations for donating tokens to Contributors.

Automated Donations are an automated inbuilt feature of the Vote blockchain.

At the start, the monthly rate of Automated Donations is 0.05% from each public address' balance, and the donors (Voters) can monthly change the rate by 5%  through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).




<h1>8 &nbsp Proposals</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there are Automatic Proposals and Non-Automatic Proposals.

Automatic Proposals happen each 30 days and are the following ones:

* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the monthly rate of Automated Donations by 5%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the maximum number of the positions of Validator by 0.1%

Non-Automatic Proposals may start at any moment (Slot) and are the following ones:

* proposal to appoint a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of Contributor
* proposal to dismiss a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor

Voting on each proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots, each Slot is 0.4 second).





<h1>9 &nbsp Competitive Quadratic Voting</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there is Competitive Quadratic Voting, a specific voting system.

The "competitive" word means that on each proposal, competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

> <b>The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals</b>.

For example, while voting on a proposal — on appointing a certain person (Public Address) to the position of Contributor — some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The "quadratic" word, in its turn, means that the Voting Power of each bet is calculated as a square root of the number of tokens.

For example, 

* if Voter’s bet is 1 Hand, the Voting Power of this bet is 1
* if Voter’s bet is 100 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 10
* if Voter’s bet is 1,000,000 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 1,000

and so on.

At the last Slot (during each voting), the Voting Power of all the FOR bets are summarized and the Voting Power of all the AGAINST bets are also summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of at least 15% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 15%.

For example, if a vote on a certain proposal has accumulated in total:

* FOR: 3,500,000,000 Voting Power<br>

* AGAINST: 3,000,000,000 Voting Power

then,

<p>the Voting Margin is 16.67%  &nbsp (3,500,000,000 / 3,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67</p>

and,

16.67% > 15%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 15%, the decision is made.


Additionally, in order for a vote to be valid, it must meet the required 5% voter turnout.












<h1>10 &nbsp Hyde Park</h1>

Hyde Park is a set of internet sites and protocols (incl. Vote.Governance.Forum, Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Nostr) that might be used for expressing various opinions and discussing proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.

<p><i><b>Any improvement proposals on Voting System are welcome.</b></i></p>

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>


# About Technologies

Fortunately, on the table, there already are good blockchain technologies to use.

Hypothesis/Idea

The hypothesis/idea is that we might take some existing blockchain technologies — some of the most advanced blockchain technologies — and combine them.

For example, we might take code of the Solana blockchain as our codebase and combine it with code of some dApps on the Solana blockchain, of course, modifying them a bit.

**The Continuation**


<h1>11 &nbsp Technologies & Creator Thanksgiving Culture</h1>

From day one, the Vote blockchain leverages the most advanced of cutting edge blockchain technologies.

As an element of Creator Thanksgiving Culture, we establish a new fete day — Creator Thanksgiving Day — on December 30th, where people around the world might give their thanks to the most useful in-their-opinion creators of ideas and code through direct donations in tokens — including through buying NFTs of the creators.

<i>
Eventually, there might be people who are searching for the creators eligible for donations, making the lists. 
<br><br>
Some of the first names of such lists might be Anatoly Yakovenko and Fiatjaf, for example.
</i>




<h1>12 &nbsp Ideal Stablecoin</h1>
 

From day one, the Vote blockchain has the ideal stablecoin — a native stablecoin collateralized with the blockchain's native-token Vote having Decreasing-Supply.

Specific details about the ideal stablecoin are being held up for now.

*A bit more detail on this below in the chapter called **About DeFi**.*

<b>SOME OTHERS OF MY OPINIONS</b>

* About Democrscy
* About DeFi
* About NFTs
* About Bitcoin

<h1>About Democracy</h1>
 

"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter." 

Winston Churchill’s quote sums up the mainstream opinion on what it means to have a real democracy, incl. direct democracy. 

For a democracy to work well, those who are making the decisions, the average voter, need to know what is going on and be really motivated.

On the other hand, absolutely, when you treat people like mushrooms — feed them manure and keep them in the dark — you get the "average voter" awful effect.

And, when people have real power and information, when they are motivated, when the system is transparent and on blockchain, then there is a big chance we get a real democracy working well.



<h1>About DeFi</h1>

In DeFi, as it is being made for now, there are also the biggest problems that are fundamental. 

For now, state and logic (tokens and code) of each DApp are in the same place: smart-contract, so there are these 3 fundamental problems,

* a code bug of each smart-contract can result in losing funds of users — in a case of an exploit of code 

* each upgrade of each DApp involves a multi-signature of only few people that can result in losing funds of users — in a case of an unwelcome change of logic that the smart-contract work with

* each upgrade of each DApp involves a multi-signature of only few people that can result in losing funds of users — in a case of a rug-pull.

In order to solve these 3 fundamental problems, DeFi should be made another way.

In short, if you wish the roller coaster to users' funds then you use smart contracts for solving fundamental tasks like trustless stablecoins, trustless bridges and trustless trading-fee-free exchanges, but if you wish safety to users' funds then you use the blockchain's codebase for solving these fundamental tasks. I have an idea on this system.

<h1>About NFTs</h1>

NFTs are here to stay.

Moreover, in about 50 years, NFTs will most likely be used for these 3 main cases:

1. a main way for creators (incl. artists, singers, writers) to monetize their works
2. a main way for entities (incl. companies, universities, states) to organize their works
3. a main way for everyone to flex (a bit more on it below)




<h1>About Bitcoin</h1>

Some even believe Bitcoin has its value because they think Bitcoin is lots of lots of pure energy converted into a digital monetary instrument via the mining process. But in reality, inefficient (expensive) consensus does never add value to a blockchain because inefficient  consensus does never increase the consumer value of the blockchain.

Of course, for now, Bitcoin is both permissionless and highly-sustainable.

But, Bitcoin might have been the undisputed leader until some moment. For example, until there is a fundamentally better token: a token with pre-programmed decreasing of supply, with the ideal Gini, and which is fundamentally much better in other key aspects.

To Bitcoin maximalists, this is important to keep in mind that by believing that the Bitcoin blockchain will forever be the most successful one in the crypto industry, you deny the ability of our civilization to progress, incl. progress drastically.

Remember Nokia with its one billion customers, history for decades and the question in Forbes — CAN ANYONE CATCH THE CELL PHONE KING?

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/nokia.png"/>
</p>

So, as mentioned above, Bitcoin for now isn't and a lot of time further also won't be really a fixed-supply token because the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at 2140 (in 118 years).

More importantly, absolutely, Bitcoin doesn't have any pre-programmed decreasing of Supply.

Also, Bitcoin's codebase doesn't have total immutability but only relative immutability — in other words, is limitedly-changeable which, in turn, doesn't make the Bitcoin blockchain unique or better than many others.

Plus, the Bitcoin blockchain has all these unsolvable, unstoppable fundamental flaws, including the absolutely-terrible Gini and extreme inefficiency — including, in turn, extremaly-low bandwidth.

The allegedly incredibly-promising Lightning, conceived to solve the problem of extremely-low bandwidth, requires the regular user to either run a lightning node or trust the one who is running a lightning node, which respectively either won't work with the regular user  or — according to the main point of blockchain technology — is absurd.

By the way, additionally, most bitcoin trading takes place on centralized exchanges, which makes this all — according to the main point of blockchain technology — also absurd.

In the future, most likely, the word's top universities — like Stanford, Harvard, Oxford — will buy earlier Bitcoin tokens as NFTs to prove their status, their domination and superiority.

As we can see, for new blockchains there is a lot of room to improve. Surpassing the Bitcoin blockchain is possible and inevitable.



Forecast

Over time, the whole point of Bitcoin as a blockchain, thanks to its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, might be more clear and more about the same point that, for example, a Leonardo da Vinci's painting or a set of NFTs of a unique art collection has, and which is the flexing — the ultimate way for people to flex.

<i><b>Flexing as a culture, in a broad sense, might be described as showing that you are better than other people since you can have the thing other people cannot. For example, this may happen through spending significant money on a unique thing (token) proving your involvement with some unique (sometimes historical) event. Essentially, this is a way for anyone to demonstrate their domination, superiority. This is such public relations — this is about the status. And plus, of course, this does not exclude making money through reselling the unique thing (token) to someone else.</b></i>

So, the whole value of Bitcoin as a blockchain — if compared to new, more advanced blockchains going to come — might be more about its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, meaning Bitcoin tokens are much like NFTs.

Already now, the Bitcoin token isn't really fungible: each Bitcoin has its history, story and fate, meaning, its price — for example, more clean Bitcoins have more prices. Over time, this point might become even more clear to everyone — earlier Bitcoins might also have more prices.

Probably, one Satoshi is much like one NFT — much like one NFT of a unique art collection. 

The word's top universities like Stanford, Harvard, Oxford might buy earlier Bitcoin tokens as NFTs — along with their purchase of other NFTs  — to prove their status: their domination and superiority in understanding innovations.

*By the way, you might re-read this chapter every time when the Bitcoin price goes up or down.*



<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

As mentioned above, there are even more of fundamental problems than described here.

Importantly, each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve the fundamental problems.

All the fundamental problems of the blockchain industry can be solved only by highly-decentralized and highly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.

It is just a matter of time that some initiative group of people will create a blockchain of that sort.
