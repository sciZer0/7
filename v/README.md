<p align="center">
Brief Introduction<br>
</p>
<br>


This paper proposes an idea about the next-gen, layer-1, DAO-style blockchain which from day one is simultaneously:

* highly-decentralized
* highly-democratic
* highly-sustainable
* highly-efficient 
* with over 50,000 TPS
* with the native, decreasing-total-supply token
* with over 100,000,000 owners of the native token
* with the best Gini coefficient

From day one, the blockchain has over 100 million people equally owning the native token.

Thanks to the given native token with the decreasing total-supply, the blockchain creates the most valuable one in the Universe: **the token with the constantly increasing scarcity**.

High (even **extreme**) efficiency of the blockchain is possible thanks to the use of a new approach to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism — called **Proof-of-Stake-Flow** (PoSF).

Being especially-suitable for mass adoption, the blockchain might be the 1st one to achieve the market capitalization of **$20 trillion** and allow at least **100,000,000 people** from around the world to make life-changing money from investing no money — not to mention billions of people also able to benefit from it.

The narrative being defined by the blockchain also involves — among other things — the use of Soul-Bound Tokens (SBTs) and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technologies.

### About Blockchain Technology

The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless ownership systems that are highly-sustainable – meaning, whose pre-programmed works are extremely-hard, at best impossible, to harm or stop.

Specifically, permissionless ownership systems about storing and transferring tokens (values).

The only way for a blockchain to be permissionless and highly-sustainable is to simultaneously, 

* use the public-private key pair authentication mechanism

* be a highly-decentralized system of many incentivized, autonomous nodes.

Ideally, the nodes must be distributed across geographies and jurisdictions, so that the blockchain can remain permissionless and highly-sustainable even throughout geopolitical events or natural disasters.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to really build/make such permissionless systems highly-sustainable and plus, of course, as efficient as possible. 

Theoretically, a blockchain should be <b>as</b> efficient <b>as</b> possible — of course, remaining permissionless and highly-sustainable.

And, the main rule of efficiency is that you must never do more than enough.

*By the way, permissionlessness is just another word for censorship-resistance. And of course, permissionlessness and high-sustainability, both these ones together, imply trustlessness.*

Absolutely, blockchain technology causes a paradigm revolution. It is because — to even start with this single thing alone — no today's state would like to allow people to get permissionless access to value.


<br>



### *About New Culture* 

*You might, if wanted, just skip this chapter.*

Additionally, thanks to blockchain technology, it will technically be impossible for creators to keep their exclusive ownership over created digitizable things (incl. videos, audios, texts, programs) after these things become known.

It is because technically, anyone will be able to upload any known digitizable things (videos, audios, texts, programs) on a blockchain and then allow people to **permissionlessly** access/use these things at will.

For example, if the uploader wants, he/she can give **permissionless access** to uploaded digitizable things to all people around the world, and no one can prevent all willing ones from accessing/using these things (videos, audios, texts, programs) when they want.

It will be impossible to fight this trend.

As they say — change or die.

From that new perspective/vision, it is in the interests of our civilization to make the most out of the new paradigm — including, to consider it acceptable to initially allow people to freely access/use all digitizable things (incl. ideas and code) that become known.

So in particular, each code or idea that becomes known must be free. **By the way, in the crypto industry, code and ideas that have become known are already, in the vast majority, open and free.**

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s available ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.

Of course, when someone creates something new and digitizable which eventually becomes known, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it — to improve it — on their own.

Importantly, people and businesses will never stop or even slow down creating new digitizable things because creativity is in the basis of human and business nature, and on top of that, there is always a high probability that the creator will still be able to realize the first mover advantage.

In order to additionally encourage creators of digitizable things, we might also shape a Creator Thanksgiving Culture to give thanks in tokens (donations) to creators of digitizable things. Including, through buying NFTs of the creators.

<br>

### *About NFTs*

*You might also, if wanted, just skip this chapter.*

NFTs are here to stay.

Moreover, in the future, NFTs will most likely be used for these 3 main use-cases:

1. a main way for creators (incl. artists, singers, writers) to monetize their works
2. a main way for entities (incl. companies, universities, states) to organize their works
3. a main way for anyone to flex 

There will be total tokenization of the "real-world" things. Nearly everything valuable (incl. products of production) will be tokenized through NFTs.

Thanks to NFTs, for example, states will be able to significantly improve their efficiency — including, to cardinally cut tax burden on both people and businesses simultaneously, and canceling all traditional taxes to only introduce a small number of innovative taxes (self-collectable, privacy-preserving ones).

Also, for example, fans in various spheres, through buying NFTs of their idols, will be able to take special seats in the fan hierarchies of these idols. 




<br>

### About Immutability 

This might seem that ideally, in codebase of a blockchain, there should be no variables that might be adjusted and no updates that might be made in order to change the way the blockchain works.

In reality, total immutability of codebase is an impossible thing in the modern world since the blockchain inevitably risks becoming hopelessly obsolete, and also risks becoming extremely-vulnerable to possible code bugs.

So even Bitcoin's codebase is limitedly changeable — meaning, there is no total immutability, but only relative immutability — not to mention codebases of new blockçhains.

By the way, total immutability is especially not good for codebases of smart-contracts being built on and sometimes connected to changeable blockchains since if any bug is discovered in the immutable code, it cannot be fixed and users can lose all of their funds. On the other hand, changeability of codebases of the smart-contract inevitably involves, among other things, a multi-signature of only a few people that, in turn, already causes another problems. So DeFi has to be done in an absolutely another way. *I have an idea about this.*

As for codebase of a blockchain, the most right approach might be to provide fully-automated, high decentralization/democracy when realizing limited changeability of codebase — since total immutability of codebase is an impossible thing in the modern world.

So codebase (constitution) of a blockchain can have variables when values of these variables are changed only in a fully-automated, highly-decentralized/democratic way — and can have updates when these updates are accepted also in a fully-automated, highly-decentralized/democratic way.

### About Fundamental Problems of All Current Blockchains

Below are 5 fundamental problems of all current blockchains compared to the Vote Blockchain.




<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

Fundamental Problem 1 is that people build blockchains the same way as other people built states in the past: 

with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

The whole thing is that *– we can see this below –* only a highly-democratic blockchain is able to be highly-efficient – plus, remaining highly-decentralized and highly-sustainable.

Ideally, blockchains must be highly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*

<i>
<b>
For reference
<br><br>
the Solana blockchain, at its best times, processed about 30 million transactions per day, at the peak, 65 million, and is already capable of over 400 million per day — with the potential to process 60 billion transactions per day in the future. So massive votes aren't any problem now in terms of technology.
<br><br>
Plus, Garbage-Collecting technologies help reduce the blockchain's storage of no longer used/maintained data.

</b></i>



<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

Fundamental Problem 2 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there is the great unfairness — meaning, the most tokens of the blockchain are distributed to a small number of people.

*For reference,*

*Wealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than even in North Korea where nearly everything is owned by one single one and his closest ones and where the inequality Gini coefficient is **0.86** (it is 0.41 in the quite unequal US), the Gini coefficient for Bitcoin is even more terrible,  an astonishing **0.88**.*

As Vitalik said about the great unfairness of Bitcoin — Was Bitcoin really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time <b>1/4</b> of the supply had already been handed out by the end of 2010?

Although nearly the same might be said about Ethereum — Was Ethereum really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time <b>1/2</b> of the supply had already been handed out among less than 7 thousand people by the end of 2014?

Another example, the SOL token — the Solana blockchain — entered the market only after multiple private rounds, and finally just 38% of the total initial token supply went to the community.

The initial token distribution and inequality Gini coefficient aren't much better, if any better, on other existing blockchains.

Precisely the great unfairness might **most** prevent each of the existing blockchains from getting mass adoption in the long run.

Ideally, a blockchain must have executed very wide initial token distribution, and also have the ideal Gini coefficient of 0 at day one, and the best Gini coefficient in the industry further.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*




<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

Fundamental Problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to increases in transaction fees that, in its turn, always leads to increases in amounts of tokens that the contributors (miners/validators) receive while the congestions.

*For example, Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which first splits each transaction fee into the base cost and the priority fee, and then burns the former and gives the latter to the miner as a reward, is fundamentally **wrong** because this way the proposal directly makes the contributors (miners/validators) interested in network congestions, because the congestions still inevitably lead, thanks to the proposal, to increases in the contributors' rewards while the congestions.*

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to increases in transaction fees, must never lead to increases in the amounts of tokens that the contributors (miners/validators) receive — instead, all the token increases received must be burned, in other words, the so-called "priority fee" must be burned. 

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*





<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

Fundamental Problem 4 is that each of the existing blockchains is fundamentally unable to start decreasing its native token's total supply.

*For example, Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, as mentioned above, doesn't decrease the native token's total supply.* 

*So the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing its native token only at 2140 (in 118 years), and the Ethereum blockchain,  of course, never.*

Importantly, no one of the existing blockchains is able to start decreasing its native token's total supply.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its native token's total supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*





<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

Fundamental Problem 5 is that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

This problem comes from the fact that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one truly-decentralized way for a blockchain to achieve the "51% attack" resistance:

**the more the blockchain's market capitalization becomes the more of honest nodes must be added in the blockchain — in order for the blockchain to be considered sufficiently sustainable (secure).**.

According to this logic, a blockchain with a really huge market capitalization must always strive to have lots of lots of honest nodes.

At the same time, an increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's (shard's) bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, this approach means that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

Extremely importantly, increasing the number of nodes is just one of possible ways for a blockchain to achieve permissionlessness and high sustainability incl. the "51% attack" resistance.

Compared to other possible approaches, the old approach is much like adding to your car a 79th wheel, simultaneously dreaming about adding a 205th wheel.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, truly-decentralized, highly-efficient way to achieve the "51% attack" resistance – of course, remaining permissionless and highly-sustainable.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*










<p>&nbsp</p>





In fact, there are also another fundamental problems.

And, each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve the fundamental problems.

With all these fundamental problems that cannot be solved by EACH of the existing blockchains, it is for sure that for now, the industry highly needs a new, innovative, driving-force blockchain in order to finally solve all these fundamental problems and for everything else to be built on it or with it taken into account. And it cannot already be the Bitcoin blockchain, or the Ethereum Blockchain, or any other blockchain you know (incl. Solana, Aptos, Sui, Worldcoin), it should be something fundamentally new — groundbreaking.

<h2 align="center">THE VOTE BLOCKCHAIN</h2>
<p align="center">In More Detail</p>

<br>
<p>
<b>
This is a blockchain which is extremely-hard to surpass/improve in each key aspect.

<p>&nbsp</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/vote.png" height="100"><br>
</p>

<p><b>Next-Gen, Layer-1, DAO-style Blockchain</b></p>
<b>FROM DAY ONE</b><br>

* highly-decentralized
* highly-democratic
* highly-sustainable
* highly-efficient
* with over 50,000 TPS
* with the native, decreasing-total-supply token
* with over 100,000,000 owners of the native token
* with the best Gini coefficient 

<p>&nbsp</p>



<h2>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h2>

The Vote token (**VTT**) is a native token of the Vote blockchain.

The Maximum Supply of the Vote token is created at the Genesis Block, and is 10,000,000 **VTT**.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 **Hands**.

The Hand (**Hand**) is the smallest unit of the Vote token.

After creating the Genesis Block, no printing of the Vote token is possible.


<br>

<h2>2 &nbsp Fair Full-Scale Distribution</h2>

After the creation of the Genesis Block, right away, through a fair airdrop, all 10,000,000 Vote tokens (100%) are for free equally distributed among over 100,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting. 

This distribution mechanism provides the ideal Gini coefficient of 0 at day one, and the best Gini coefficient in the industry further.

*I have an idea on how to cheaply get over 100,000,000 unique people with their Public Addresses, and how about 2,000,000 of those people might become an especially powerful driving force of the blockchain.*

<br>



<h2>3 &nbsp Over 50,000 TPS</h2>

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is over 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 

<br>



<h2>4 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h2>

Transaction Fees are paid by Account Owners to process transactions (instructions) on the blockchain.

Rents are paid by Account Owners to keep accounts' data stored on the blockchain. 

Transaction Fees and Rents are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).

All Transaction Fees and Rents paid (100%) are burned. 


<i><b>
This approach results in decreasing the Vote token's Circulating Supply from day one.

Decreasing Circulating Supply is the impossible thing for each of the existing blockchains.

At best, such a highly-deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of the Vote Token over time.</b></i>

<br>


<h2>5 &nbspVoting System</h2>


The Vote blockchain has a highly-decentralized governance.

This is a DAO-style blockchain leveraging all benefits and the best practices of DAOs.

The blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Competitive Voting (inbuilt)
* Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Non-Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Hyde Park
 
<br>

<h2>6 &nbsp Competitive Voting</h2>



On the Vote blockchain, each vote on each proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots, each Slot is 0.4 second).

And, there is a specific voting system: Competitive Voting.

The "competitive" word means that while voting on each proposal, competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

> <b>The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals</b>.

At the last Slot (during each voting), all votes are summarized — all "FOR" bets are summarized and all "AGAINST" bets are also summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of at least 15% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 15%.

For example, if a vote on a certain proposal has accumulated in total:

* FOR: 3,500,000,000 Votes<br>

* AGAINST: 3,000,000,000 Votes

then,

<p>the Voting Margin is 16.67%<br>
(3,500,000,000 / 3,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67</p>

and,

16.67% > 15%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 15%, the decision is made.

Additionally, in order for a vote to be valid, it must meet the required 1% voter turnout.


<i><b>
The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is that the more tokens are being locked up for voting, the less tokens are in real circulation. Also importantly, Voters (users) lock up their tokens not in exchange for receiving rewards/interest.  

From day one, on the Vote blockchain, there are over 100,000,000 Voters and a lot of Automatic and Non-Automatic Proposals to vote For or Against. 
 
Even though not each Voter might vote, and plus, a Voter might spend only their idle time on voting, nevertheless at best, massive competitive-votings, happening on the Vote blockchain, might additionally decrease the Vote token's real circulating supply significantly — of course, resulting in an additional rise in the voting power of the Vote token.
</b></i>




<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

**To be continued a bit below...**



<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1 align="center">Idea/Hypothesis</h1>

* A Lot of Room To Improve
* New Approach to Consensus Mechanism or Extremely-Efficient True-Decentralization


## A Lot of Room To Improve


*For reference,*

*During just one single year (2022), when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalization was on average just about $575 billion, nevertheless, the users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid the miners/validators, for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $10 billion — as rewards for blocks and transaction fees.*

This means that the annual costs are as big as 1.7% from the blockchain's market capitalization. Considering the extremely-low bandwidth of just 3-7 transactions per second, this is extremely-expensive.

<p><i>
Also, for reference,

* about 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* about 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.
</i></p>

As we can see, current decentralization isn't the one of a highly-high height but at the same time is extremely-expensive.

The thing is that we can achieve high decentralization and sustainability for extremely-low costs.




## New Approach to Consensus Mechanism or Extremely-Efficient True-Decentralization

This new approach allows us to achieve consensus highly efficiently.

Unlike the traditional approach to PoS, the new approach doesn't require stakes from Validators, and,  of course, doesn't require doing massive hash-works unlike PoW. 

Specifically in this paper as an example, the new approach uses Solana's Proof-Of-History mechanism and is much like Solana's PoS consensus mechanism — but again, consensus is happening without any stakes.

The whole trick is that this consensus might be efficiently used only by highly-decentralized and highly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.


<p align="center"><b>For reference, How Solana Works</b></p>


At any given moment, the Solana blockchain (i.e. each node of the Solana blockchain called Validator) is storing the full list of all current working Validators. 

All the Validators being in the list should have the same hardware capabilities.

Each Validator is a person (possibly anonymous) running their Solana node and having their publicly-known Public Address. And exactly this Public Address serves to identify any given Validator in the list.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp List of All Validators:</p>


|    Stake    | Public Address of Validator|
| ----------- | ---------------------------|
|       1     |     banjo3banjo3banjo3ba   |
|       1     |     eag1eeag1eeag1eeag1e   |
|       1     |     zabu6zabu6zabu6zabu6   |
|       1     |     samurai4samurai4samu   |
|       1     |     venus7venus7venus7ve   |
|       1     |     montra8montra8montra   |
|       1     |     panda5panda5panda5pa   |
|       1     |     gex2gex2gex2gex2gex2   |


</p>

Also, time is splitted into Slots, each Slot is 0.4 second.

At any given Slot, in the list, there is only one Validator (called leader-Validator or Leader) which is creating the block.

Only the leader-Validator can create the block and stream it to other Validators.

All other Validators are only verifying the work of the leader-Validator, and then they send their successful verifications – as their "For" votes – back to the Leader.

In other words, all other Validators are voting – each successful verification of the block by a Validator serves as one "For" vote for the consensus algorithm.

So the creation of the block by the leader-Validator and the verification of the block by other Validators are happening in parallel. This is a very good thing. And this becomes possible thanks to the Proof-Of-History mechanism which just helps replace the communication overhead with cheap local calculations. <i>If this last sentence isn't understandable, relax. Doesn't matter here.</i>

Each Validator is automatically appointed in the position of the Leader and then replaced with another Validator according to the Leader Schedule which is automatically calculated from the list by the stake-weighted selection algorithm.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Leader Schedule:</p>

|    Slot     | Public Address of Leader|

|      31     |  samurai4samurai4samu   |
|      32     |  samurai4samurai4samu   |

The Leader Schedule is calculated far in advance of the slots it appoints Leaders in.

Importantly, at any given moment, there is the list of all working Validators, meaning, any Validator being out of the list cannot be participating in the work and cannot be harming the consensus.

Plus, any Validator being in the list, just trying to do something wrong, will be punished by slashing its stake.

Technically, even 3 honest nodes (Validators) are enough for the Solana blockchain to function normally, maintaining the bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS.

Idea/Hypothesis

The idea/hypothesis is that 

1. when a  list of all working Validators (possibly anonymous) is known (Solana's approach), and

2.  when the list is limited to 500 Validators, and

3. when each Validator is added in the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Voting), and

4. when each Validator in the list doesn't need to have any money/token and put it in the blockchain as their stake, and 

5. when each Validator in the list, being a programming engineer, is receiving very-generous Automated Donations (<b>≈$1 million per year</b>) just for working honestly, and

6. when each Validator in the list is competing very hard with other Validators from the waiting list for being in the list in order to be receiving these very-generous Automated Donations, and

7. when any malicious Validator in the list, just trying to do something wrong, is automatically dropped from the list, and

8. when any suspicious Validator may also be dropped from the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Voting),

<b>then we might suppose there are very huge incentives for each Validator to work honestly and most likely the wide majority of (or even all) Validators in the list will work honestly.</b>


<b>
And we might, for example, just drop out the Solana's stake-weighted selection algorithm, used to automatically from the list calculate the Leader Schedule — and replace it with a random number selection algorithm to automatically from the list calculate the leader schedule, providing nearly the same time period in the position of the Leader to all Validators in the list.
</b>
<br><br>

Simply put, we give each Validator very-generous incentives to work honestly and replace the automatic stake-slashing — in case the Validator tries doing something wrong — with the automatic dropping from the list.

Old Approach: Why would ever a Validator work honestly? It is because he/she is afraid of losing a small part of their stake — in the event of automatic stake-slashing. Greed-Driven Consensus.

New Approach: Why would ever a Validator work honestly? It is because he/she is afraid of losing a huge flow of tokens/stakes for years — in the event of automatic dropping from the list. Much bigger incentives to work honestly. Huge-Greed-Driven Consensus.<br><br>


**Old Approach:**<br>
Capital At Risk:<br>
A small part of stake, if any — or a small amount of reward<br>
**——**<br>
**New Approach:**<br>
Capital At Risk:<br>
A huge flow of tokens/stakes for years<br><br>

This new approach to consensus might be called **Proof-of-Stake-Flow** (PoSF).

Importantly, since even 3 honest nodes (Validators) are enough for such a Solana-type blockchain to function normally, maintaining the bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS, this over 166 fold margin of safety of 500 Validators (500/3=166.67) might be a sufficient condition for the blockchain to be considered sustainable.

Moreover, there are about 200 countries around the world. At best, from one single country, there might even be just 2-3 Validator/s — highly-autonomous Validator/s. Plus, Validators might be obligated to run their own nodes only on their own standalone rigs, not servers of server providers. And also, Validators might use not one but some validator-clients. This all would make the whole system highly-sustainable, meaning, extremely-hard, at best impossible, to harm or stop.

As a result, the blockchain might be highly (even extremely) efficient.

<i>If to suppose that such a blockchain's market capitalization would be $20 trillion, the overall yearly costs would still be only $500 million (1*500=500). Accounting for a high bandwidth of over 50,000 TPS, it might be hard to calculate how many times this blockchain might be more efficient than, only theoretically, the Bitcoin blockchain at the same market capitalization or even the Solana Blockchain.</i>


So we can surely achieve high decentralization and sustainability for extremely-low costs.

**The Continuation**





<h2>7 &nbsp Contributors</h2>

Contributors are people who may be contributing to the Vote blockchain and receiving daily very-generous Automated Donations — <b>in total ~ $1 million per year per person</b> — from Voters.

Each Contributor may only be contributing in the Vote blockchain in these two roles simultaneously: 

* as a Validator (node running)
* as a Developer (protocol maintenance and upgrades).

On the Vote Blockchain, there are the maximum number of positions of Contributor.

At the start, the maximum number is 500 and this number can be changed — either increased or decreased — by 0.1% through democratic voting (Competitive Voting). *In order for a vote on the given proposal to be valid, there may be the condition that it must meet the required 50% voter turnout.*


Each Contributor is a person (possibly anonymous) with their Public Address.

Any person (Public Address) is appointed to the position of Contributor only by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Voting).

Each candidate/applicant for a position of Contributor have to find a way to prove their qualification and usefulness for the Vote blockchain in order to consequently become Contributor — optionally, using their Web3-native,decentralized identity (SBTs) to prove their qualificational/social graph in a privacy-preserving manner, and also using **Hyde Park**.

*Decentralized Identity (DI) combined with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technologies might  play an increasingly important role in Web3's evolution.*

At any moment, a person  (Public Address) being in the position of Contributor may be dropped from the position through democratic voting (Competitive Voting).


*The first 30 persons might be appointed to the positions of Contributor by an initiative group. And it might be a number of Contributors enough to start the blockchain's testnet and make the fair airdrop, after which, it might be possible to have formed a full list of 500 Contributors through democratic voting (Competitive Voting) by the moment of the launch of the mainnet.*

<br>


<h2>8 &nbsp Automated Donations</h2>


<p align="center"><b>For reference, How Accounts Work On Solana</b></p>

Solana’s account model is much more complicated than, for example, the Ethereum's account model. 

On the Solana blockchain, accounts are much like files with additional features.

Accounts store their own states, incl. balances.

Accounts are held in validator memory and pay "rent" to stay there.

The security model enforces that an account's state can only be modified/controlled by a special inbuilt program — System Program.  The System Program has been built in Solana's codebase.

In other words, all accounts, by default, are owned by the special inbuilt program, the System Program, and only this special program is capable of modifying/controlling the account's state.

<br>

On the Vote Blockchain, there is a special type of account — Protocol&User Controlled Account (PUCA).

The state of such an account (PUCA) is modified/controlled by the two special inbuilt programs — System Program 1 and System Program 2.

System Program 1 is a special inbuilt code that modifies/controls the account's state. *It may be completely the same as Solana's System Program*.

System Program 2 is a special inbuilt code that modifies/controls the account's state only according to the Automated Donations Program — which, in turn, features the monthly rate of Automated Donations.

*As mentioned above, on the Vote Blockchain, there are Automated Donations for donating tokens to Contributors.*

*Automated Donations are an element of a Creator Thanksgiving Culture, and also are an automated inbuilt feature of the Vote blockchain.*

At the start, the monthly rate of Automated Donations is 0.08% from each Public Address' balance, and the rate may monthly be charged — either increased or decreased — by 5% through democratic voting (Competitive Voting). 

*Importantly, if there is one or more vacant positions of Contributor (at the start of the testnet, for example,  there might be up to 470 vacant positions: 500-30=470), all Automated Donations collected for the vacant positions are burned.*

*Of course, some number of positions of Contributor might be taken by specific persons or working groups (Public Addresses with multi-signatures) in order for the blockchain to fund and fulfill specific tasks assosiated with some public/common goods,*

* funding coordinating protocol maintenance and upgrades, incl. funding additional external developers and auditors to test and find exploit
* funding documentation and research.

*Treasury funds, theoretically, might also be formed up the same way.*




<br>

<h2>9 &nbsp Voting Proposals</h2>

On the Vote blockchain, there are Automatic Proposals and Non-Automatic Proposals.

Automatic Proposals happen each 30 days and are the following ones:

* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the monthly rate of Automated Donations by 5%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the maximum number of the positions of Validator by 0.1%

Non-Automatic Proposals may start at any moment (Slot) and are the following ones:

* proposal to appoint a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of Contributor
* proposal to dismiss a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor





<br>
<h2>10 &nbsp Hyde Park</h2>

Hyde Park is a set of internet sites and protocols (incl. Vote.Governance.Forum, Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Nostr) that might be used for expressing various opinions and discussing proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.

<p><i><b>Any improvement proposals on Voting System are welcome.</b></i></p>

# About Technologies

On the table, there already are good blockchain technologies to use.

Idea/Hypothesis

The idea/hypothesis is that we might take some existing blockchain technologies — some of the most advanced blockchain technologies — and combine them.

For example, we might take core code of the Solana blockchain as our codebase and combine it with code of some dApps on the Solana blockchain — of course, modifying this all a bit.

<h2>11 &nbsp Technologies & Creator Thanksgiving Culture</h2>

From day one, the Vote blockchain leverages the most advanced of cutting edge blockchain technologies.

As an element of Creator Thanksgiving Culture, we establish a new fete day — Creator Thanksgiving Day — on December 30, where people around the world may give their thanks in tokens (donations) to the most useful in-their-opinion creators of digitizable things (incl. creators of ideas and code). Also, through buying NFTs of the creators. 


*Eventually, there might be people on social networks who are searching for creators eligible for donations, making the lists.*

*Some of names of such lists might be Anatoly Yakovenko and Fiatjaf, for example.*

## Some Other Thoughts

* *About Democracy*
* *About Nakamoto Coefficient*
* *About Bitcoin*

### *About Democracy*
 

"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter." 

Winston Churchill’s quote sums up the mainstream opinion on what it means to have a real democracy, incl. direct democracy. 

The thing is that for a democracy to work well, those who are making the decisions, the average voter, need to 

1. have real power to change things
2. know what is going on
3. be really motivated.

On the other hand, absolutely, when you treat people like mushrooms — feed them manure and keep them in the dark — you get the "average voter" awful effect.

And, when people have real power and information, when they are motivated, when the system is transparent and on  blockchain, then there is a big chance we get a real democracy working well.




### *About Nakamoto Coefficient*

For now, the industry highly needs a new universal coefficient that describes the minimum amount of effort it would take to disrupt any given blockchain. 

The Nakamoto coefficient is not good for this since it is one-sided — doesn't comprehensively take into account the main point of blockchain technology.

As a result, the Nakamoto coefficient doesn't take into account all possible decentralized ways for a blockchain to achieve permissionlessness and high sustainability incl. the "51% attack" resistance.








### *About Bitcoin*

Of course, Bitcoin is special.

Some even believe Bitcoin has its value because they think Bitcoin is lots of lots of pure energy converted into a digital monetary instrument via the mining process. But in reality, inefficient (expensive) consensus does never add value to a blockchain because inefficient  consensus does never increase the consumer value of the blockchain.

Instead, the customer value of a blockchain only relies on how big are problems that the blockchain solves, and how small are flaws the blockchain has.

The Bitcoin blockchain, for now, is both permissionless and highly-sustainable, and it gets totally along with the main point of blockchain technology — to start with.

But, as mentioned above, Bitcoin for now isn't and a lot of time further also won't be really a fixed-supply token because the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at 2140 (in 118 years).

More importantly, absolutely, Bitcoin doesn't have any pre-programmed decreasing of supply.

Also, Bitcoin's codebase doesn't have total immutability but only relative immutability — in other words, is limitedly-changeable which, in turn, doesn't make the Bitcoin blockchain unique or better than others in terms of immutability of codebase.

Plus, the Bitcoin blockchain has all those other unsolvable, unstoppable fundamental problems (flaws), including the absolutely-terrible Gini and extreme inefficiency — including, in turn, extremaly-low bandwidth.

The allegedly incredibly-promising Lightning, conceived to solve the problem of extremely-low bandwidth, requires the regular user to either run a lightning node or trust the one who is running a lightning node, which respectively either won't work with the regular user  or — according to the main point of blockchain technology — is absurd.

By the way, additionally, most bitcoin trading takes place on centralized exchanges, which makes this all — according to the main point of blockchain technology — also absurd.


Forecast

Bitcoin might have been the leader until some moment. For example, until there is a better token — a token with a fundamentally better tokenomics (with pre-programmed decreasing of supply, big user base, the ideal Gini), and which is fundamentally much better in many other key aspects.

Over time, the whole point of Bitcoin as a blockchain, thanks to its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, might be more clear and more about the same point that, for example, a Leonardo da Vinci's painting or a set of NFTs of a unique art collection has, and which is the flexing — the ultimate way for people to flex.

<i><b>Flexing as a culture, in a broad sense, might be described as showing that you are better than other people since you have the thing other people cannot have or don't understand the need to have. For example, this may happen through spending significant money on a unique thing (token) proving your involvement with some unique (sometimes historical) event. Essentially, this is a way for anyone to demonstrate their domination, superiority. This is such public relations — this is about the status. And plus, of course, this does not exclude making money through reselling the unique thing (token) to another one.</b></i>

So, the whole value of Bitcoin as a blockchain — if compared to new, more advanced blockchains going to come — might be more about its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, meaning Bitcoin tokens might be much like NFTs.

Already now, Bitcoin tokens aren't really fungible: each Bitcoin has its history, story and fate, meaning, its price — for example, more clean Bitcoins have more prices. Over time, this point might become even more clear to everyone — earlier Bitcoins might also have more prices.

The word's top universities like Stanford, Harvard or Oxford might buy earlier Bitcoin tokens as NFTs — along with their purchase of other NFTs  — to prove their status: their domination and superiority in understanding innovations.


To Bitcoin Maximalists

Of course, in society there is inertia and you can console yourself with the network effect and Lindy effect.

But by believing that the Bitcoin blockchain will forever be the most successful one in the crypto industry, you deny the ability of our civilization to progress.

Remember Nokia with one billion customers, history for decades, and the question in Forbes — CAN ANYONE CATCH THE CELL PHONE KING?

# CONCLUSION

As mentioned above, there are even more of fundamental problems than described here.

Importantly, each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve the fundamental problems.

All the fundamental problems of the blockchain industry can be solved only by highly-decentralized and highly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.

It is just a matter of time that some initiative group of people will create a blockchain of that sort.

*Additionally, I have a lot of other ideas — incl. ideas about DeFi in general, plus specifically, about stablecoins, exchanges, bridges, and also about tokenized commits (tokenized code).*
