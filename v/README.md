# Our Ideology

Every code created must be open and free – including, each code which happens to be known must be free.<br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

We should form a Creator Donation Culture for giving thanks in tokens to creators of ideas and code.<br>

Summarizing, when people create something, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it – to improve it.

<b>About Blockchain Technology</b>

 
The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless ownership systems that are extremely-sustainable – meaning, whose pre-programmed works are extremely hard, at best impossible, to stop.

The only way for a blockchain to be extremely-sustainable (really-unstoppable) is to be a people-ruled system – without being under control of any single entity.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to build/make such systems as fast, reliable, scalable  and, of course, efficient as possible.

*Importantly, decentralization is not the goal, decentralization is just a tool to reach permissionlessness and sustainability – instead, exactly these both ones, permissionlessness and sustainability are the goal. And of course, permissionlessness is just another word for censorship-resistance, and also of course, these both, permissionlessness and sustainability imply trustlessness.*



<b>About the Greatest Values</b>

In Inflationary Economy, there is nothing new and valuable.

All that Inflationary Economy (endless emissions of regular tokens) can give us is bubbles, each of which will inevitably burst.

On the other hand, the Bitcoin token is allegedly considered a non-inflationary token — a fixed-supply token. But in reality, the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at 2140 (in 118 years).

More importantly, the greatest values in the Universe are not the fixed-supply tokens, but the decreasing-supply tokens.



<b>About Fundamental Problems of Bitcoin </b>
 
Why were all fundamental problems of Bitcoin – including the terrible Gini and inefficiency – predefined?

This is because Bitcoin was the first decentralized token and the creator had to use only reliable solutions – not necessarily simultaneously efficient but necessarily extremely-reliable.

Including, in order for the Bitcoin blockchain to get started, the creator at start had to use the extremely-reliable incentive system, implementing the unproportionally big rewards for the most earliest adopters (miners) and predefining the terrible Gini — and also to use the extremely-reliable but unfortunately extremely-inefficient consensus.

Fortunately, we now have the opportunity to find and use solutions that are both reliable and efficient, simultaneously.

*Plus, to all Bitcoiners, this is important to keep in mind that by assuming that the Bitcoin blockchain will forever be the most successful one in the crypto industry, you deny the ability of our civilization to progress — incl. progress drastically.*

<b>About a New Blockchain</b>

This paper proposes an idea of a new, layer 1, DAO-style blockchain which from day one is simultaneously:

* extremely-decentralized
* extremely-democratic
* extremely-sustainable ***
* extremely-efficient
* with 50,000 TPS
* with a Decreasing-Supply Token
* with the ideal Gini coefficient
* with 1 million users


*** – extremely-sustainable (at best, normally, and probably at worst)

<b>About Fundamental Problems of All Current Blockchains in More Detail</b>



<h2 align="center">
Six Fundamental<br>
Problems of All Current<br>
Blockchains Compared<br>
to the Vote Blockchain
</h2>





<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

Problem 1 is that we people build blockchains the same way as we built states: 

with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

The whole thing is that *– we can see this below –* only an extremely-democratic blockchain is able to be extremely-efficient – plus, remaining extremely-decentralized and extremely-sustainable.

Ideally, blockchains must be extremely-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*

<i>
<b>
For reference, Solana's routine – on its best times – was about 30 million transactions per day. At the peak, 65 million. So a massive voting (by, say, 1-10 million voters) isn't any problem now in terms of technology.</b></i>



<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

Problem 2 comes from Problem 1.

Problem 2 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there is the inequality – great inequality.

*For reference,*

*Wealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than in North Korea where the inequality Gini coefficient is 0.86 (it is 0.41 in the quite unequal US): the Gini coefficient for Bitcoin is an astonishing 0.88.*

Ideally, a blockchain must have the ideal Gini coefficient of 0 from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*




<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

Problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in translation fees which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in transaction fees, must never lead to an increase in the amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive — instead, this whole token increase received must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*








<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

Problem 4 is the inability of each of the existing blockchains to truly start decreasing its Circulating Supply.

For example, the Bitcoin blockchain will stop its printing only at 2140 (in 118 years), and the Ethereum blockchain – maybe at one day in the future. No one of them is really able to truly start decreasing its Circulating Supply.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*





<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

Problem 5 is that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

This problem comes from the fact that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one truly-decentralized way for a blockchain to build up its "51% attack" resistance:

**the more the blockchain's market capitalization becomes the more of honest nodes must be added in the blockchain — in order for the blockchain to be considered sufficiently sustainable and secure.**.

According to this logic, a blockchain with a really huge market capitalization must always strive to have lots of lots of honest nodes.

At the same time, an increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, this approach means that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, truly-decentralized, more efficient way to build up its "51% attack" resistance – of course, remaining extremely-decentralized, extremely-democratic, extremely-sustainable and secure.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*



<h3 align="center">Problem 6</h3>

Problem 6 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for validators and developers if calculated per person.

Ideally, a blockchain must create extremely-generous long-term incentives for validators and developers when calculated per person — in order to always be able to attract highly-professional developers from both Web2 and Web3, and as a result, to always be a sustainable working system.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*

**Motto: Like Bitcoin Just Better**



<h1>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h1>

Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 10,000,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.



<h1>2 &nbsp Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution</h1>

The whole Maximum Supply (10,000,000 Vote tokens) is created at the Genesis Block.

And right away, through a fair airdrop, all the 10,000,000 Vote tokens (100%) for free are equally distributed among 1,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting.



<h1>3 &nbsp 50,000 TPS</h1>

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 






<h1>4 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h1>

The whole Maximum Supply is created at the Genesis Block.

There will never be the printing any more.

Gas Fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).

All Gas fees (100%) are burned. 

This all results in decreasing the Vote token's Circulating Supply from day one.

<i><b>
Decreasing Circulating Supply is the impossible thing for each of the existing blockchains.

At best, such an extremely-deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of the Vote Token over time.</b></i>


<h1>5 &nbspVoting System</h1>


The Vote blockchain operates based on direct vote by token holders.

This is a DAO-style blockchain leveraging all benefits of DAO culture.

The blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Non-Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Competitive Quadratic Voting (inbuilt)
* Hyde Park
 
<i><b>
The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is that the more tokens are being locked for voting, the less tokens in real circulation.
 
From day one, on the Vote blockchain, there are 1,000,000 Voters and a lot of Automatic and Non-Automatic Proposals to vote. 
 
Importantly, even though not each Voter might vote, and plus, a Voter might spend only their idle time on voting, nevertheless at best, massive competitive-votings, happening on the Vote blockchain, might additionally decrease the Vote token's real circulating supply significantly — of course, resulting in an additional rise in the voting power of the Vote token.

And of course, there will be such things as voting on funding common goods and retaining the Voter's personal achievements by the  SBT/NFT — and a lot of other good things.
</b></i>




<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

**To be continued a bit below...**



<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>

* A Lot of Room To Improve
* New Approach to Consensus or Extremely Efficient True-Decentralization


## A Lot of Room To Improve


*For reference,*

*During just one single year (2022), when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalization was on average just about $576 billion, nevertheless, the users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid the miners/validators, for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $10 billion.*

This means that the annual costs are as big as 1.7% from the blockchain's market capitalization. It is extremely expensive.

<p><i>
Also, for reference,

* about 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* about 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.
</i></p>

As we can see, current true-decentralization isn't the one of the extremely-high level but at the same time is extremely expensive.

We can reach true-decentralization of the extremely-high level for the extremely-low costs.




## New Approach to Consensus or Extremely Efficient True-Decentralization

This new approach allows us to reach consensus extremely efficiently.

The approach doesn't require stakes from Validators (unlike POS) and of course doesn't require doing massive hash-works (unlike POW). 

At the same time, the approach includes Solana's Proof-Of-History mechanism — but again, in the  whole, the consensus is happening without stakes.

The whole trick is that this approach might be efficiently used only by extremely-decentralized and extremely-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.


<p align="center"><b>For reference, about Solana</b></p>


At any given moment, the Solana blockchain is storing the full list of all current Validators. 

All the Validators being in the list should have the same hardware capabilities.

Each Validator is a person (possibly anonymous) with their publicly-known Public Address, and exactly this Public Address serves to identify any given Validator in the list.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Full List of All Current Validators:</p>


|    Stake    | Public Address of Validator|
| ----------- | ---------------------------|
|       1     |     pumbaaxk3q32fg1n5zet   |
|       1     |     eag1e1j3rg9y3h5kh8rl   |
|       1     |     zazuph19rg463k9dkn2a   |
|       1     |     jaqee3hm8fy6fg1n9kes   |
|       1     |     ninja1b7mg8y3h9kh82n   |
|       1     |     scrat3hk23v5fd3a9dut   |
|       1     |     panda3hk8f56js1n9zet   |
|       1     |     vixeyygfpsdkfse59hde   |


</p>

Also, time is splitted into Slots, each Slot is 400 milliseconds.

At any given Slot, in the list, there is only one Validator (called leader-Validator or Leader) which is creating the block.

Only the leader-Validator can create the block and stream it to other Validators.

All other Validators are only verifying the work of the leader-Validator, and then they send their successful verifications – as their votes – back to the Leader.

In other words, all other Validators are voting – each successful verification of the block by a Validator serves as one vote for the consensus algorithm.

So the creation of the block by the Leader and the verification of the block by other Validators are happening in parallel. This is a very good thing. And this becomes possible thanks to the Proof-Of-History mechanism which just helps replace the communication overhead with cheap local calculations. <i>If this last sentence isn't understandable, relax. Doesn't matter here.</i>

Each leader-Validator is automatically selected (calculated) from the list by a stake-weighted selection algorithm and then is automatically rotated with another Validator in the list according to the leader schedule also calculated automatically by the stake-weighted selection algorithm.


<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Leader Schedule:</p>

|    Slot     | Public Address of Leader|
| ----------- | ------------------------|
|       1     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       2     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       3     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       4     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       5     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       6     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       7     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       8     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |


Importantly, at any given moment, there is the list of all working Validators, meaning, any Validator being out of the list cannot be participating in the work and cannot be harming the consensus.

Plus, any Validator being in the list, just trying to do something wrong, will be punished by slashing its stake – and, theoretically, might be dropped out of the list.

Hypothesis/Idea

The hypothesis/idea is that 

1. when the list of all current Validators (possibly anonymous) is known (Solana's approach), and

2.  when the list is limited to 150 Validators, and

3. when each Validator is added in the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting), and

4. when each Validator in the list doesn't need to have any money and put it as the stake, and 

5. when each Validator in the list is receiving the extremely generous Automated Donations (~ <b>$3 million per year</b>) just for working honestly, and

6. when each Validator in the list is competing very hard with other Validators from the waiting list for being in the list in order to be receiving these extremely generous Automated Donations, and

7. when any malicious Validator in the list, just trying to do something wrong, is automatically dropped out of the list and may, by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting) be replaced with a Validator from the waiting list, and

8. when any suspicious Validator may also be dropped out of the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting),

9. <b>then we might consider there is very huge incentives for each Validator to work honestly</b>, and 

<b>then the wide majority of (or even all) Validators in the list will work honestly.</b> 
<b>
And we might, for example, just drop out the Solana's stake-weighted selection algorithm, used to automatically (1)select (calculate) the leader-Validator from the list and (2)calculate the leader schedule from the list, — and replace it with a random number selection algorithm to automatically (1)select (calculate) the leader-Validator from the list and (2)calculate the leader schedule from the list.
</b>
<br><br>

Importantly, even 3 honest nodes (validators) are enough for such a Solana-type blockchain to function normally, maintaining the bandwidth of 50,000 TPS. So this 50 fold margin of safety (of 150 Validators) might be  the sufficient condition for the blockchain to be considered sustainable.

Moreover, there are about 200 countries around the world. At best, from one single country, there might even be just 1 Validator — extremely-autonomous Validator — and this would make the whole system extremely-sustainable, meaning, extremely hard, at best impossible, to stop.

<i><b>
It is important to note, increasing decentralization (increasing the number of nodes) all time  shouldn’t  be the goal, because decentralization is just a tool for a permissionless blockchain to be unstoppable. So unstoppableness is the goal.
<br><br>
At the same time, the main principle of efficiency is that you must never do more than enough – and exactly this way each blockchain must work.
</b></i>

Actually, these 150 extremely-decentralized (extremely-autonomous) Validators – which are extremely motivated to work honestly and which are selected and rotated through democratic, massive voting – might be  the sufficient condition for a blockchain to be considered extremely-decentralized and extremely-sustainable.
<br><br>
As a result, the blockchain might be more than <b>170 times (16,800.00%)</b> more efficient than, for example, the Bitcoin blockchain.
<br><br>


> <p>&nbsp &nbsp More than <b>170 times (16,800.00%) more efficient than the Bitcoin blockchain</b>

 
<br>
So we can surely reach true-decentralization of the extremely-high level for the extremely-low costs.
<br><br>


<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>






**The Continuation**

<h1>6 &nbsp Contributors</h1>

Contributors are people who may be contributing to the Vote blockchain and receive the extremely generous Automated Donations from Voters.

On the Vote Blockchain, there are the minimum and maximum for the number of positions of Contributor.

The minimum is 150 positions.

At the start, the maximum is 160 positions and this number can be changed through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).

Each Contributor is a person (possibly anonymous) with their Public Address.

Each Contributor receives the extremely generous Automated Donations from Voters (~ $3 million per year).

Each Contributor may only be contributing in the Vote blockchain in these two roles simultaneously: 

* as a Validator (node running)
* as a Developer (protocol maintenance and upgrades).

Any person (Public Address) is appointed to the position of Contributor only by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).

Each applicant must find a way to prove their qualification/usefulness for the Vote blockchain in order to become Contributor and can use <b>Hyde Park</b> for this.

At any moment, a person  (Public Address) being in the position of Contributor may be dropped out of the position by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).


*Some number of positions of Contributor (say 10) might be taken by specific entities (Public Addresses with multisigs) for funding some public/common goods,*

* funding coordinating protocol maintenance and upgrades, incl. funding additional external developers and auditors to test and find exploit
* funding documentation and research.

*The first 15 persons are appointed to the positions of Contributor by an initiative group.*







<h1>7 &nbsp Automated Donations</h1>

Automated Donations are an element of a Creator Donation Culture.

On the Vote Blockchain, there are Automated Donations for donating tokens to Contributors.

Automated Donations are an automated inbuilt feature of the Vote blockchain.

At the start, the monthly rate of Automated Donations is 0.05% from each public address' balance, and the donors (Voters) can monthly change the rate by 5%  through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).






<h1>8 &nbsp Competitive Quadratic Voting</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there is Competitive Quadratic Voting, a specific voting system.

The "competitive" word means that on each proposal, competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

> <b>The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals</b>.

For example, while voting on a proposal — on appointing a certain person (Public Address) to the position of Contributor — some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The "quadratic" word, in its turn, means that the Voting Power of each bet is calculated as a square root of the number of tokens.

For example, 

* if Voter’s bet is 1 Hand, the Voting Power of this bet is 1
* if Voter’s bet is 100 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 10
* if Voter’s bet is 1,000,000 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 1,000

and so on.

At the last Slot (during each voting), the Voting Power of all the FOR bets are summarized and the Voting Power of all the AGAINST bets are also summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of at least 15% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 15%.

For example, if a vote on a certain proposal has accumulated in total:

* FOR: 3,500,000,000 Voting Power<br>

* AGAINST: 3,000,000,000 Voting Power

then,

<p>the Voting Margin is 16.67%  &nbsp (3,500,000,000 / 3,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67</p>

and,

16.67% > 15%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 15%, the decision is made.


<h1>9 &nbsp Proposals</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there are Automatic Proposals and Non-Automatic Proposals.

Automatic Proposals happen each 30 days and are the following ones:

* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the monthly rate of Automated Donations by 5%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the maximum number of the positions of Validator by 0.1%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the Rent Level by 20%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the Garbage Level by 20%

Non-Automatic Proposals may start at any moment (Slot) and are the following ones:

* proposal to appoint a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of Contributor
* proposal to dismiss a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor

* <b>special proposal</b> to instantly dismiss a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor

Voting on a regular proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots, each Slot is 0.4 second).

Voting on a special proposal lasts 2 hours (9,000 slots, each Slot is 0.4 second).

<p><i><b>Any suggestions on Proposals and voting conditions are welcome.</b></i></p>






<h1>10 &nbsp Hyde Park</h1>

Hyde Park is a set of internet sites and protocols (incl. Vote.Governance.Forum, Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Nostr) that might be used for expressing various opinions and discussing proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.









<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>


# About Technologies

Thanks to good people, on the table, there already are good blockchain technologies to use.

The hypothesis/idea is that we might take some existing blockchain technologies — some of the most advanced blockchain technologies — and combine them.

For example, we might take the code of the Solana blockchain itself as codebase and combine it with code of some apps on the Solana blockchain, of course, modifying them a bit.



<p>&nbsp</p>

**The Continuation**


<h1>11 &nbsp Technologies & Creator Donation Culture</h1>

From day one, the Vote blockchain leverages the most advanced of cutting edge blockchain technologies.

As an element of a Creator Donation Culture, we establish a new fete day — Creator Thanksgiving Day — on December 30th where people around the world might give their credits (thanks) to the most useful in-their-opinion creators of ideas and code through direct donations of tokens — including through buying NFTs of the creators.

<i>
Eventually, there might probably be people who are searching for the creators eligible for donations, making the lists. 
<br><br>
Some of the first names of such lists might be Anatoly Yakovenko and Fiatjaf, for example.
</i>



<h1>About DeFi</h1>

In DeFi as it is made now, there are also fundamental problems. Specifically, 2 problems.  In order to solve these 2 fundamental problems DeFi should be made in another way, and this is beyond the scope of this paper.



<h1>About NFTs</h1>

NFTs are here to stay.

And moreover, in about 50 years, NFTs will most likely be used for these 3 main cases:

1. a main way for creators (incl. singers, writers) to monetize their works
2. a main way for entities (incl. companies, universities, states) to organize their works
3. a main way for people to flex (a bit more on it below)




<h1>About Bitcoin</h1>

Of course, the Bitcoin blockchain is both permissionless and extremely-sustainable. But, it is extremely-sustainable so far.

As mentioned above, Bitcoin now isn't really a fixed-supply currency because the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at 2140 (in 118 years).

Also, more importantly, Bitcoin, absolutely, isn't ultra sound money because there isn't any pre-programmed decrease of Circulating Supply.

Plus, the Bitcoin blockchain has the irremovable fundamental flaws, including the terrible Gini and highest inefficiency. As Vitalik said about the Gini of Bitcoin — <b>was Bitcoin really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time 1/4 of the supply had already been handed out by the end of 2010?</b>

Some believe that Bitcoin has the value because Bitcoin is lots of lots of pure energy converted into a digital monetary instrument via the mining process. But in reality, inefficient (expensive) consensus does never add the value to a blockchain because inefficient  consensus does never increase the consumer value of the blockchain.

The allegedly incredibly-promising Lightning requires the regular user to either run a lightning node or trust the one who is running a lightning node, which respectively either won't work with the regular user  or — according to the main point of blockchain technology — is absurd.

Additionally, most bitcoin trading takes place on centralized exchanges, which also makes this all — according to the main point of blockchain technology — absurd.

As we can see, for new blockchains there is a lot of room to improve. Surpassing the Bitcoin blockchain is possible and inevitable.

Over time, the whole point of Bitcoin as a blockchain, thanks to its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, might become more clear and might be more about the same point that, for example, a Leonardo da Vinci's painting or a set of NFTs of a unique art collection have, and which is the flexing — the ultimate way for people to flex.

<i><b>Flexing as a culture, in a broad sense, might be described as showing that you are better than other people since you can have the thing other people cannot have. For example, this may happen through spending significant money on a unique thing (token) proving your involvement with some unique (sometimes historical) event. Essentially, this is a way for anyone to demonstrate their domination, superiority. And plus of course, this does not exclude making money through reselling a unique thing (token) to another one.</b></i>

Probably, the whole value of Bitcoin as a blockchain — if compared to new more advanced blockchains — is more about its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, meaning each of the Bitcoin tokens is a NFT.

Already now, the Bitcoin token isn't really fungible: each Bitcoin has its history, story and fate, meaning, its price — for example, more clean Bitcoins have a more price. Over time, this point might become even more clear to everyone — earlier Bitcoins might also have a more price.

Probably, one Satoshi is like one NFT — much like one NFT of a unique art collection. 

By the way, you might re-read this chapter every time when the Bitcoin price goes up or down.



<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

As mentioned above, there are even more of fundamental problems than described here.

Importantly, each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve the fundamental problems.

All the fundamental problems of the blockchain industry can be solved only by extremely-decentralized and extremely-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.

Among the closest targets might be things even more ambitious than ones mentioned here.

And this is just a matter of time that some initiative group of people will create a blockchain of that sort.

Last but Not Least

In a world of exchanges and aggregators of exchanges, there is one thing to always keep in mind — the thing was said by the most technically-advanced people in the industry, including Anatoly Yakovenko — <b>sharding sucks</b>. Not to mention Layer 2 solutions built over sharding.
