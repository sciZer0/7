# Our Ideology

Every code created must be open and free – including, each code which happens to be known must be free.<br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

We should form Creator Thanksgiving Culture to give thanks in tokens (donations) to creators of ideas and code.<br>

Summarizing, when people create something (idea/code), there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it — to improve it.

<h2 align="center">Abstract</h2>

<b>About the Vote Blockchain</b>

This paper proposes an idea about a next-gen, layer 1, DAO-style blockchain which from day one is simultaneously:

* highly-decentralized
* highly-democratic
* highly-sustainable
* highly-efficient
* with over 50,000 TPS
* with a native, Decreasing-Supply Token
* with the ideal stablecoin
* with the ideal Gini coefficient
* with over 1 million users

All of it, including high (even extreme) efficiency, is possible thanks, among other things, to the use of a new consensus mechanism.

*To Bitcoin maximalists, this is important to keep in mind that by believing that the Bitcoin blockchain will forever be the most successful one in the crypto industry, you deny the ability of our civilization to progress — incl. progress drastically.*




<b>About Blockchain Technology</b>

The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless ownership systems that are highly-sustainable – meaning, whose pre-programmed works are extremely-hard, at best impossible, to stop.

Specifically, permissionless ownership systems about storing and transferring value.

The only way for a blockchain to be highly-sustainable (really-unstoppable) is to be a people-ruled decentralized system – without being under control of any single entity.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to build/make such systems as fast, scalable, reliable, secure, decentralized, sustainable  and, of course, efficient as possible.

*By the way, permissionlessness is just another word for censorship-resistance, and of course, permissionlessness and sustainability, both these ones together, imply trustlessness.*


<b>About Immutability</b>

This might seem that ideally, in codebase, there should be no variables that might be adjusted and no updates that might be made in order to change the way the blockchain works.

In reality, total immutability of codebase is an impossible thing in the modern world since the blockchain inevitably risks becoming hopelessly obsolete. So even Bitcoin's codebase is limitedly changeable — meaning, there is no total immutability, but just relative immutability — not to mention codebases of new blockçhains.

By the way, total immutability is especially not good for smart-contracts being built on and sometimes connected to changeable blockchains since if any bugs are discovered in the immutable code, they cannot be fixed and users can lose all of their funds. *A little more on problems of smart-contracts and solutions a bit below.*

As for codebase, the most right approach might be to provide high decentralization/democracy when realizing limited changeability of codebase — since total immutability of codebase is an impossible thing in the modern world.

So codebase (constitution) can have variables when values of these variables are changed only in an highly decentralized/democratic way — and can have updates when these updates are accepted also in  an highly decentralized/democratic way.


<b>About the Greatest Values</b>

In Inflationary Economy, there is nothing new and valuable.

All that Inflationary Economy (endless emissions of regular tokens) can finally give us is a devaluation of values and bubbles.

On the other hand, the Bitcoin token is allegedly considered a non-inflationary token — a fixed-supply token. But in reality, the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at 2140 (in 118 years).

Moreover, the greatest values in the Universe are not fixed-supply tokens, but decreasing-supply tokens.

A decreasing-supply, permissionless, decentralized token with its own dedicated blockchain is the thing our civilization has never known before and fundamentally is much better than digital gold.



<b>About Fundamental Problems of All Current Blockchains</b>


<h2 align="center">
Seven Fundamental<br>
Problems of All Current<br>
Blockchains Compared<br>
to the Vote Blockchain
</h2>





<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

Problem 1 is that we people build blockchains the same way as we built states: 

with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

The whole thing is that *– we can see this below –* only an highly-democratic blockchain is able to be highly-efficient – plus, remaining highly-decentralized and highly-sustainable.

Ideally, blockchains must be highly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*

<i>
<b>
For reference, Solana's routine – on its best times – was about 30 million transactions per day. At the peak, 65 million. So a massive voting (by, say, 1-10 million voters) isn't any problem now in terms of technology.</b></i>



<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

Problem 2 comes from Problem 1.

Problem 2 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there is the inequality – great inequality.

*For reference,*

*Wealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than in North Korea where the inequality Gini coefficient is 0.86 (it is 0.41 in the quite unequal US): the Gini coefficient for Bitcoin is an astonishing 0.88.*

As Vitalik said about the terrible Gini of Bitcoin — Was Bitcoin really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time 1/4 of the supply had already been handed out by the end of 2010?

Although, nearly the same might be said about Ethereum — Was Ethereum really a fair launch considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the time 1/2 of the supply had already been handed out among less than 7 thousand people by the end of 2014?

Another example, SOL tokens — the Solana blockchain — entered the market only after multiple private rounds, and finally just 38% of the total initial token supply went to the community.

On other blockchains, the conditions aren't much better, if any better.

Ideally, a blockchain must have the ideal Gini coefficient of 0 from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*




<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

Problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in transaction fees which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in transaction fees, must never lead to an increase in the amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive — instead, this whole token increase received must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*








<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

Problem 4 is that each of the existing blockchains is fundamentally unable to start decreasing its native token's Circulating Supply.

For example, the Bitcoin blockchain will stop its printing only at 2140 (in 118 years), and the Ethereum blockchain – maybe at one day in the future. But in reality, no one of them and other existing blockchains is able to start decreasing its native token's Circulating Supply.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its native token's Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*





<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

Problem 5 is that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

This problem comes from the fact that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one truly-decentralized way for a blockchain to build up its "51% attack" resistance:

**the more the blockchain's market capitalization becomes the more nodes must be added in the blockchain — in order for the blockchain to be considered sufficiently sustainable (secure).**.

According to this logic, a blockchain with a really huge market capitalization must always strive to have lots of lots of honest nodes.

At the same time, an increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's (or shard's) bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, this approach means that increasing the inefficiency (overhead) is the goal for each of the existing blockchains.

By the way, endless increasing decentralization — endless increasing of the number of nodes — must never be the goal, decentralization is just a tool that should be sufficient to reach permissionlessness and high sustainability – and instead, exactly permissionlessness and high sustainability, both these ones together, are the goal.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, truly-decentralized, more efficient way to build up its "51% attack" resistance – of course, remaining highly-decentralized, highly-democratic and highly-sustainable (secure).

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*




<h3 align="center">Problem 6</h3>

Problem 6 is that each of the existing blockchain is fundamentally unable to create the ideal stablecoin — a really decentralized, permissionless, over-collateralized, ultra-stable and safe stablecoin — meaning, among other things, which never relies on banks and multisigs, and where a code bug can never result in losing funds of users.

Without the ideal stablecoin, plus having all these unsolvable fundamental problems, getting adoption for crypto in general is really hard, if ever possible.

Ideally, a blockchain must have the ideal stablecoin from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 7</h3>

Problem 7 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for its validators and developers if calculated per person.

Ideally, a blockchain must always create highly-generous incentives for its validators and developers when calculated per person — in order to be a more sustainable working system in the long term.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

*The solution is described below.*

<p>&nbsp</p>


In fact, there are also another fundamental problems.

And, each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve the fundamental problems.

With all these fundamental problems that cannot be solved by all the existing blockchains, it is for sure that for now, the industry highly needs a new, innovative, driving-force blockchain in order to solve all these problems and for everything else to be built on it or with it taken into account. And it cannot already be the Bitcoin blockchain or the Ethereum Blockchain or any other blockchain you know, it should be something fundamentally new —  groundbreaking.

**Motto: Like Bitcoin Just Better**



<h1>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h1>

Vote (VOTE) is a native token of the Vote blockchain.

The whole Maximum Supply of the Vote token is created at the Genesis Block.

The Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 10,000,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.

After creating the Genesis Block, no printing of the Vote token is possible.




<h1>2 &nbsp Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution</h1>

After creating the Genesis Block right away, through a fair airdrop, all the 10,000,000 Vote tokens (100%) are for free equally distributed among over 1,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting.

Each social media influencer — who claims their desire — is guaranteed to receive their share in the Vote token.



<h1>3 &nbsp Over 50,000 TPS</h1>

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is over 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 






<h1>4 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h1>

Transaction Fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).

All Transaction fees (100%) are burned. 

This results in decreasing the Vote token's Circulating Supply from day one.

<i><b>
Decreasing Circulating Supply is the impossible thing for each of the existing blockchains.

At best, such an highly-deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of the Vote Token over time.</b></i>




<h1>5 &nbspVoting System</h1>


The Vote blockchain operates based on direct vote by token holders — meaning, it has an highly-decentralized governance. 

This is a DAO-style blockchain leveraging all benefits and all the best practices of DAOs.

The blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Non-Automatic Proposals (inbuilt)
* Competitive Quadratic Voting (inbuilt)
* Hyde Park
 
<i><b>
The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is that the more tokens are being locked up for voting, the less tokens are in real circulation — Voters (users) lock up their tokens not in exchange for rewards/interest.  

From day one, on the Vote blockchain, there are over 1,000,000 Voters and a lot of Automatic and Non-Automatic Proposals to vote For or Against. 
 
Importantly, even though not each Voter might vote, and plus, a Voter might spend only their idle time on voting, nevertheless at best, massive competitive-votings, happening on the Vote blockchain, might additionally decrease the Vote token's real circulating supply significantly — of course, resulting in an additional rise in the voting power of the Vote token.
</b></i>




<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

**To be continued a bit below...**



<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>

* A Lot of Room To Improve
* New Consensus Mechanism or Extremely Efficient True-Decentralization


## A Lot of Room To Improve


*For reference,*

*During just one single year (2022), when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalization was on average just about $575 billion, nevertheless, the users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid the miners/validators, for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $10 billion — as rewards for blocks and transaction fees.*

This means that the annual costs are as big as 1.7% from the blockchain's market capitalization. It is highly expensive.

<p><i>
Also, for reference,

* about 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* about 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.
</i></p>

As we can see, current decentralization isn't the one of an highly-high level but at the same time is highly expensive.

The thing is that we can achieve high decentralization and sustainability for extremely-low costs.




## New Consensus Mechanism or Extremely Efficient True-Decentralization

This new consensus mechanism allows us to reach consensus highly efficiently.

The new consensus doesn't require stakes from Validators (unlike POS) and of course doesn't require doing massive hash-works (unlike POW). 

At the same time, the new consensus mechanism uses Solana's Proof-Of-History mechanism and is much like Solana's POS consensus mechanism — but again, consensus is happening without any stakes.

The whole trick is that this consensus might be efficiently used only by highly-decentralized and highly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.


<p align="center"><b>For reference, How Solana Works</b></p>


At any given moment, the Solana blockchain (i.e. each node of the Solana blockchain called Validator) is storing the full list of all current working Validators. 

All the Validators being in the list should have the same hardware capabilities.

Each Validator is a person (possibly anonymous) running their Solana node and having their publicly-known Public Address. And exactly this Public Address serves to identify any given Validator in the list.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Full List of All Current Validators:</p>


|    Stake    | Public Address of Validator|
| ----------- | ---------------------------|
|       1     |     pumbaaxk3q32fg1n5zet   |
|       1     |     eag1e1j3rg9y3h5kh8rl   |
|       1     |     zazuph19rg463k9dkn2a   |
|       1     |     jaqee3hm8fy6fg1n9kes   |
|       1     |     ninja1b7mg8y3h9kh82n   |
|       1     |     scrat3hk23v5fd3a9dut   |
|       1     |     panda3hk8f56js1n9zet   |
|       1     |     vixeyygfpsdkfse59hde   |


</p>

Also, time is splitted into Slots, each Slot is 400 milliseconds.

At any given Slot, in the list, there is only one Validator (called leader-Validator or Leader) which is creating the block.

Only the leader-Validator can create the block and stream it to other Validators.

All other Validators are only verifying the work of the leader-Validator, and then they send their successful verifications – as their "For" votes – back to the Leader.

In other words, all other Validators are voting – each successful verification of the block by a Validator serves as one "For" vote for the consensus algorithm.

So the creation of the block by the Leader and the verification of the block by other Validators are happening in parallel. This is a very good thing. And this becomes possible thanks to the Proof-Of-History mechanism which just helps replace the communication overhead with cheap local calculations. <i>If this last sentence isn't understandable, relax. Doesn't matter here.</i>

Each Validator is automatically appointed in the position of the Leader and then replaced with another Validator according to the Leader Schedule which is automatically calculated from the list by the stake-weighted selection algorithm.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Leader Schedule:</p>

|    Slot     | Public Address of Leader|
| ----------- | ------------------------|
|       1     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       2     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       3     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       4     |  Ninja1b7Mg8Y3H9kh82n   |
|       5     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       6     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       7     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |
|       8     |  Panda3hk8f56JS1N9zet   |


Importantly, at any given moment, there is the list of all working Validators, meaning, any Validator being out of the list cannot be participating in the work and cannot be harming the consensus.

Plus, any Validator being in the list, just trying to do something wrong, will be punished by slashing its stake – and, theoretically, might be dropped out of the list.

Hypothesis/Idea

The hypothesis/idea is that 

1. when the list of all working Validators (possibly anonymous) is known (Solana's approach), and

2.  when the list is limited to 250 Validators, and

3. when each Validator is added in the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting), and

4. when each Validator in the list doesn't need to have any money/token and put it in the blockchain as their stake, and 

5. when each Validator in the list, being a programming engineer, is receiving the highly generous Automated Donations (~ <b>$2 million per year</b>) just for working honestly, and

6. when each Validator in the list is competing very hard with other Validators from the waiting list for being in the list in order to be receiving these highly generous Automated Donations, and

7. when any malicious Validator in the list, just trying to do something wrong, is automatically dropped out of the list, and

8. when any suspicious Validator may also be dropped out of the list by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting),

<b>then we might suppose there are very huge incentives for each Validator to work honestly and most likely the wide majority of (or even all) Validators in the list will work honestly.</b>


<b>
And we might, for example, just drop out the Solana's stake-weighted selection algorithm, used to automatically from the list calculate the Leader Schedule — and replace it with a random number selection algorithm to automatically from the list calculate the leader schedule, providing the same time period in the position of the Leader to all Validators in the list.
</b>
<br><br>

Simply put, we give each Validator extremely generous incentives to work honestly and replace the automatic stake-slashing — in case the Validator tries doing something wrong — with the automatic dropping-out from the list.

POS Consensus: Why would ever a Validator work honestly? It is because he/she is afraid of losing tokens — in the event of automatic stake-slashing. Greed-Driven Consensus.

New Consensus: Why would ever a Validator work honestly? It is because he/she is afraid of losing the stream of tokens for years — in the event of automatic dropping-out from the list. A lot bigger incentives to work honestly. A-lot-of-Greed-Driven Consensus.


Importantly, even 3 honest nodes (validators) are enough for such a Solana-type blockchain to function normally, maintaining the bandwidth of 50,000 TPS. So this over 83 fold margin of safety (of 250 Validators, 250/3=83.33) might be  the sufficient condition for the blockchain to be considered sustainable.

Moreover, there are about 200 countries around the world. At best, from one single country, there might even be just 1 Validator — highly-autonomous Validator — and this would make the whole system highly-sustainable, meaning, extremely-hard, at best impossible, to stop.


As a result, the blockchain might be highly efficient.

<i>If to suppose that such a blockchain's market capitalization would be $20 trillion, the overall yearly costs would still be just the same $500 million (2*250=500). Accounting for a high bandwidth of 50.000 TPS, it might be hard to calculate how many times this blockchain might be more efficient than, theoretically, the Bitcoin blockchain at the same market capitalization or even the Solana Blockchain.</i>


So we can surely achieve high decentralization and sustainability for extremely-low costs.
<br><br>


<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>






**The Continuation**

<h1>6 &nbsp Contributors</h1>

Contributors are people who may be contributing to the Vote blockchain and receiving daily the highly generous Automated Donations — <b>in total ~ $3 million per year per person</b> — from Voters.

Each Contributor may only be contributing in the Vote blockchain in these two roles simultaneously: 

* as a Validator (node running)
* as a Developer (protocol maintenance and upgrades).

On the Vote Blockchain, there are the maximum number of positions of Contributor.

At the start, the maximum number is 250 (positions) and this number can be changed through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).

Each Contributor is a person (possibly anonymous) with their Public Address.

Any person (Public Address) is appointed to the position of Contributor only by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).

Each candidate/applicant for a position of Contributor must find a way to prove their qualification and usefulness for the Vote blockchain in order to become Contributor and for this can use <b>Hyde Park</b>.

At any moment, a person  (Public Address) being in the position of Contributor may be dropped out of the position by Voters through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).


*Some additional number of positions of Contributor might be taken by specific people (Public Addresses with multisigs) for funding some public/common goods,*

* funding coordinating protocol maintenance and upgrades, incl. funding additional external developers and auditors to test and find exploit
* funding documentation and research.

*The first 30 persons might be appointed to the positions of Contributor by an initiative group. And it might be an enough number to start the blockchain  and make the fair airdrop, and after which, it might be possible to form a final list of 150 Contributors along the way — through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).*




<h1>7 &nbsp Automated Donations</h1>

Automated Donations are an element of a Creator Donation Culture.

On the Vote Blockchain, there are Automated Donations for donating tokens to Contributors.

Automated Donations are an automated inbuilt feature of the Vote blockchain.

At the start, the monthly rate of Automated Donations is 0.05% from each public address' balance, and the donors (Voters) can monthly change the rate by 5%  through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting).




<h1>8 &nbsp Competitive Quadratic Voting</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there is Competitive Quadratic Voting, a specific voting system.

The "competitive" word means that on each proposal, competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

> <b>The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals</b>.

For example, while voting on a proposal — on appointing a certain person (Public Address) to the position of Contributor — some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The "quadratic" word, in its turn, means that the Voting Power of each bet is calculated as a square root of the number of tokens.

For example, 

* if Voter’s bet is 1 Hand, the Voting Power of this bet is 1
* if Voter’s bet is 100 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 10
* if Voter’s bet is 1,000,000 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 1,000

and so on.

At the last Slot (during each voting), the Voting Power of all the FOR bets are summarized and the Voting Power of all the AGAINST bets are also summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of at least 15% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 15%.

For example, if a vote on a certain proposal has accumulated in total:

* FOR: 3,500,000,000 Voting Power<br>

* AGAINST: 3,000,000,000 Voting Power

then,

<p>the Voting Margin is 16.67%  &nbsp (3,500,000,000 / 3,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67</p>

and,

16.67% > 15%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 15%, the decision is made.


Additionally, in order for a vote to be valid, it must meet the required 5% voter turnout.

<h1>9 &nbsp Proposals</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, there are Automatic Proposals and Non-Automatic Proposals.

Automatic Proposals happen each 30 days and are the following ones:

* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the monthly rate of Automated Donations by 5%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the maximum number of the positions of Validator by 0.1%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the Rent Level by 20%
* proposal to change – either increase or decrease – the Garbage Level by 20%

Non-Automatic Proposals may start at any moment (Slot) and are the following ones:

* proposal to appoint a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of Contributor
* proposal to dismiss a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor

* <b>emergency proposal</b> to instantly dismiss a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor

Voting on a regular proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots, each Slot is 0.4 second).

Voting on a emergency proposal lasts 2 hours (9,000 slots, each Slot is 0.4 second).


<p><i><b>Any suggestions on Proposals and voting conditions are welcome.</b></i></p>






<h1>10 &nbsp Hyde Park</h1>

Hyde Park is a set of internet sites and protocols (incl. Vote.Governance.Forum, Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Nostr) that might be used for expressing various opinions and discussing proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.

# About Technologies

Thanks to good people, on the table, there already are good blockchain technologies to use.

The hypothesis/idea is that we might take some existing blockchain technologies — some of the most advanced blockchain technologies — and combine them.

For example, we might take the code of the Solana blockchain itself as codebase and combine it with code of some apps on the Solana blockchain, of course, modifying them a bit.



<p>&nbsp</p>

**The Continuation**


<h1>11 &nbsp Technologies & Creator Donation Culture</h1>

From day one, the Vote blockchain leverages the most advanced of cutting edge blockchain technologies.

As an element of Creator Thanksgiving Culture, we establish a new fete day — Creator Thanksgiving Day — on December 30th where people around the world might give their credits (thanks) to the most useful in-their-opinion creators of ideas and code through direct donations in tokens — including through buying NFTs of the creators.

<i>
Eventually, there might probably be people who are searching for the creators eligible for donations, making the lists. 
<br><br>
Some of the first names of such lists might be Anatoly Yakovenko and Fiatjaf, for example.
</i>





<h1>12 &nbsp Ideal Stablecoin</h1>
 

From day one, the Vote blockchain has the ideal stablecoin, which is a really decentralized, permissionless, over-collateralized, ultra-stable, safe stablecoin — meaning, among other things, which never relies on banks and multisigs, and where a code bug can never result in losing funds of users.

Specific details are being held up for now.

*A bit more detail on this below in the chapter called **About DeFi**.*





<br><br><br>
SOME OF MY THOUGHTS 

<h1>About DeFi</h1>

In DeFi, as it is being made for now, there are also the biggest problems that are fundamental. 

Specifically, there are these 2 fundamental problems,

* for now, state and logic (tokens and code) of a DApp are in the same place: smart-contract, so a code bug can (often does) result in losing funds of users

* for now, necessary upgrades of a DApp involve multisigs that can (often does) result in rug-pulling, i.e. again in losing funds of users.

In order for us to solve these 2 fundamental problems, DeFi should be made in another way, and this is beyond the scope of this paper.



<h1>About NFTs</h1>

NFTs are here to stay.

And moreover, in about 50 years, NFTs will most likely be used for these 3 main cases:

1. a main way for creators (incl. artists, singers, writers) to monetize their works
2. a main way for entities (incl. companies, universities, states) to organize their works
3. a main way for people to flex (a bit more on it below)




<h1>About Bitcoin</h1>

Of course, for now the Bitcoin blockchain is both permissionless and highly-sustainable. But, it might have been highly-sustainable for a while until some moment — for example, until there is a token with pre-programmed decreasing of supply.

So, as mentioned above, Bitcoin now isn't really a fixed-supply token because the Bitcoin blockchain will stop printing Bitcoin just at 2140 (in 118 years).

More importantly, absolutely, Bitcoin doesn't have any pre-programmed decreasing of Supply.

Also, the Bitcoin blockchain has the irremovable fundamental flaws, including the terrible Gini and high inefficiency, including extremaly-low bandwidth.  

The allegedly incredibly-promising Lightning, conceived to solve the problem of extremely-low bandwidth, requires the regular user to either run a lightning node or trust the one who is running a lightning node, which respectively either won't work with the regular user  or — according to the main point of blockchain technology — is absurd.

As we can see, for new blockchains there is a lot of room to improve. Surpassing the Bitcoin blockchain is possible and inevitable.

Some believe that Bitcoin has its value because Bitcoin is lots of lots of pure energy converted into a digital monetary instrument via the mining process. But in reality, inefficient (expensive) consensus does never add value to a blockchain because inefficient  consensus does never increase the consumer value of the blockchain.

Over time, the whole point of Bitcoin as a blockchain, thanks to its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, might be more clear and more about the same point that, for example, a Leonardo da Vinci's painting or a set of NFTs of a unique art collection has, and which is the flexing — the ultimate way for people to flex.

<i><b>Flexing as a culture, in a broad sense, might be described as showing that you are better than other people since you can have the thing other people cannot have. For example, this may happen through spending significant money on a unique thing (token) proving your involvement with some unique (sometimes historical) event. Essentially, this is a way for anyone to demonstrate their domination, superiority. And plus of course, this does not exclude making money through reselling a unique thing (token) to another one.</b></i>

So, the whole value of Bitcoin as a blockchain — if compared to new, more advanced blockchains going to come — might be more about its unique (historical) status of the 1st cryptocurrency, meaning each of the Bitcoin tokens is much like a NFT.

Already now, the Bitcoin token isn't really fungible: each Bitcoin has its history, story and fate, meaning, its price — for example, more clean Bitcoins have a more price. Over time, this point might become even more clear to everyone — earlier Bitcoins might also have a more price.

Probably, one Satoshi is much like one NFT — much like one NFT of a unique art collection. 

By the way, you might re-read this chapter every time when the Bitcoin price goes up or down.



<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

As mentioned above, there are even more of fundamental problems than described here.

Importantly, each blockchain existing in 2023 is fundamentally unable to solve the fundamental problems.

All the fundamental problems of the blockchain industry can be solved only by highly-decentralized and highly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.

It is just a matter of time that some initiative group of people will create a blockchain of that sort.
