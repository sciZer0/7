# Our Fundamentals

Every code created must be open and free (Open Source, GPL).<br>

Everyone must always feel free to use other people’s ideas and code in order to make the lives of lots of lots of people better.<br>

And of course, we should be forming a Creator Donation Culture for giving thanks in tokens to creators of ideas and code.<br>

When people create something not good enough, there must be absolute freedom for everyone to surpass it – to improve it.

 
<p>&nbsp</p>
 <h1 align="center">THE VOTE BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
 
<p>&nbsp</p>
 <h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>

The main point of blockchain technology is to allow people to build permissionless ownership systems whose pre-programmed works are extremely hard – at best, impossible  – to stop.

On the other hand, the main task of developers is to build these systems such swift and efficient as possible.
 
 

<h1 align="center">5 Problems of Current Blockchains</h1>

<h3 align="center">Problem 1</h3>

The problem 1 is that we (people) build blockchains the same way as we built states: 

with kings (founders), top servants (top developers/validators/miners) and really rightless people (users). 

Of course, declaring the improvement of democracy in the future.

Ideally, blockchains must to be truly-democratic from day one and exactly people (users) must rule the blockchains.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

**For reference, Solana's routine – on its best times – was about 30 million transactions per day. At the peak, 65 million. So a massive voting (by, say, 1 million voters) isn't any problem now in terms of technology.**


<h3 align="center">Problem 2</h3>

The problem 2 is the inability of each of the existing blockchains to truly start decreasing its Circulating Supply.

Ideally, a blockchain must start decreasing its Circulating Supply from day one.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.


<h3 align="center">Problem 3</h3>

The problem 3 is that on each of the existing blockchains, each network congestion always leads to an increase in gas prices which, in its turn, always leads to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive.

Ideally, network congestions, inevitably leading to an increase in gas prices, must never lead to an increase in an amount of tokens that the servants (miners/validators) receive — instead, this whole token increase received must be burned.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.




<h3 align="center">Problem 4</h3>

The problem 4 is that, for now, in the industry, there is the mainstream wrong belief that there is only one truly-decentralized way for a blockchain to build up its "51% attack" resistance:

**to more and more increase a number of honest nodes in the blockchain**.

At the same time, the increase in a number of nodes doesn't increase the blockchain's bandwidth proportionally, if ever.

Actually, such an approach means that increasing overhead (efficiency) is the target for each of the existing blockchains.

Ideally, a blockchain must use another, more efficient, truly-decentralized way to build up its "51% attack" resistance – of course, remaining truly-decentralized and truly-democratic.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.



<h3 align="center">Problem 5</h3>

The problem 5 is that on each of the existing blockchains, there are low incentives for validators and developers if calculated per person.

Ideally, a blockchain must create highly generous incentives for validators and developers when calculated per person — in order to be a more sustainable working system.

The Vote blockchain ideally solves this problem from day one.

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p align="center">
Actually, there are many more problems.

**Motto: Like Others Just Better**



<h1>1 &nbsp Maximum Supply</h1>

Maximum Supply is 10,000,000 Vote tokens.

Each Vote token is divided into 100,000,000 Hands.

The Hand is the smallest unit of the Vote token.



<h1>2 &nbsp Unprecedented Full-Scale Distribution</h1>

The whole Maximum Supply (10,000,000 Vote tokens) is created at the Genesis Block.

And right away, through a fair airdrop, all the 10,000,000 Vote tokens (100%) for free are equally distributed among 1,000,000 people who become Voters (users).

Through a fair airdrop excluding the multi-accounting.



<h1>3 &nbsp 50,000 TPS</h1>

From day one, the blockchain’s bandwidth is 50,000 Transactions Per Second, with the potential to process 700,000 TPS in the future. 



<h1>4 &nbsp Free Transactions</h1>

There are no Gas fees for simple transactions, meaning, it is a freemium model blockchain.

A simple transaction is a transaction performing a transfer of tokens from one address not associated with a smart contract to another address also not associated with a smart contract.

Simply put, this includes, among other cases, that each transfer of tokens from one regular user to another is for free and that each transfer of tokens involving a smart contract will be with a Gas fee.

*An user, if there is a congestion (if ever), may set a Gas fee for their simple transaction, meaning, only at its worst the Vote blockchain might take Gas fees for simple transactions – while each of the existing blockchains always does it -- because any transactions without Gas fees aren't possible on regular blockchains.*



<h1>5 &nbsp Possible DDoS/Spam Attacks</h1>

Possible DDoS/Spam attacks, due to the fact that all simple transactions are free and hence can be created in enormous amounts, are beaten the same way as it is already done in relation to other possible DDoS/Spam attacks that can, for example, be requesting the Block Height.



<h1>6 &nbsp Gas Fees</h1>

Users pay Gas Fees only for some sorts of transactions.

Specifically, an user pays a Gas fee for deploying a smart contract and for making a transaction involving a smart contract.

Gas fees are paid in the Vote token (in Hands).


<h1>7 &nbsp Order of Transactions in Each Block</h1>

During each 400-millisecond slot, from the transactions received but yet not executed, the ordered list of transactions (maximum ~ 20,000) is automatically formed in the following order:

1. transactions with Gas fees are automatically ordered in descending order of Gas

2. simple transactions without Gas fees are automatically ordered with a random number algorithm.

If the total number of transactions, received but yet not executed, is bigger than the maximum block size (~20,000 transactions) – the remaining transactions will participate in competition during the next slot, according to the same order described above.

*This approach greatly reduces an unjust value-extraction done by miners/validators on AMM exchanges, not excluding an unjust value-extraction done by algorithmic traders, and plus, of course, completely excludes this phenomenon on order-book exchanges.*



<h1>8 &nbsp Decreasing Circulating Supply</h1>

From day one, all Gas fees, received on each block, are burned, resulting in a decrease of  the Vote token's Circulating Supply.

*Decreasing Circulating Supply is the impossible thing for each of the existing blockchain.*

*This is better than even there were the everyday halving in the Bitcoin Blockchain — since this is Decreasing Circulating Supply, not Increasing Circulating Supply.*

*At best, such an extremely deflationary nature of tokenomics should result in a great rise in the voting power of the Vote Token over time.*

<p>&nbsp</p>

**To be continued a bit below...**





<p>&nbsp</p>

<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>

* New Approach to Consensus
* Highly Efficient True-Decentralization


## New Approach to Consensus

This new approach allows to reach consensus highly efficiently.

The approach doesn't require stakes from Validators (unlike POS) and of course doesn't require doing massive hash-works (unlike POW). 

At the same time, the approach includes the Solana's Proof-Of-History mechanism — but again, in the  whole, the consensus is happening without stakes.

The approach might be efficiently used only by truly-decentralized and truly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.

<p align="center"><b>For reference, about Solana</b></p>


At any given moment, the Solana Blockchain is storing the full list of all current Validators. 

All the Validators being on the list should have the same hardware capabilities.

Also, at any given moment, there is only one Validator (leader-Validator) which is creating the block.

Only the leader-Validator can create the block and stream it to other Validators.

All other Validators are only verifying the work of the leader-Validator.

So the creation of the block by the leader and the verification of the block by others are happening in parallel. 

Each leader-Validator is automatically selected (calculated) from the list by a stake-weighted selection algorithm and then is automatically rotated with another Validator according to the leader schedule also calculated automatically by a stake-weighted selection algorithm.

Importantly, at any given moment, there is the list of all working Validators, meaning, any Validator being out of the list cannot be participating in the work and cannot be harming the consensus.

Plus, any Validator being in the list, just trying to do something wrong, will be punished by slashing its stake -- and, theoretically, might be dropped out of the list.

The hypothesis/idea is that 

* when the list of all current Validators (possibly anonymous) are known (Solana's approach), and

* when the list is limited to some number, and

* when each Validator is added in the list by users (Voters) through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting), and

* when each Validator in the list doesn't need to have any money and put it as the stake, and 

* when each Validator in the list is receiving the highly generous incentives (say, $5 million annually) for working properly, and

* when each Validator is competing with others very hard for being in the list in order to be receiving the highly generous incentives, and

* when any malicious Validator from the list cannot do anything wrong -- since it will be automatically dropped out of the list and replaced with a Validator from the waiting list, and

* when each Validator may also be dropped out of the list by users (Voters) through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting),

* <b>then the wide majority of (or all) Validators in the list will work properly, honestly,</b> 

and so we might, for example, just drop out the Solana's stake-weighted selection algorithm, used to automatically (1)select (calculate) the leader-Validator from the list and (2)calculate the leader schedule from the list, and replace it with a random number selection algorithm  — to automatically (1)select (calculate) the leader-Validator from the list and (2)calculate the leader schedule from the list.

Importantly, as mentioned above, there is no problem to automatically exclude any Validator from the list — if the Validator would just try doing something wrong — and replace it with any other Validator from the waiting list of persons who are wanting to become Validators for getting the highly generous incentives, and simultaneously, without a need to have any money and put it as the stake.


## Highly Efficient True-Decentralization


<p><i>
For reference,

* about 90% of the Bitcoin hashrate is controlled by 11 miner pools;
* about 90% of the Ethereum hashrate is controlled by 16 miner pools.
</i></p>

The main principle of efficiency is that you must never do more than enough – and  exactly this way each truly-decentralized blockchain must work.

How much True-Decentralization should be  there that this might be considered sufficient?

The hypothesis/idea is that

* when the list of all current Validators (possibly anonymous) are known (Solana's approach), and

* when the list is limited to some number, and

* when each Validator is added in the list by users (Voters) through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting), and

* when each Validator in the list doesn't need to have any money and put it as the stake, and 

* when each Validator in the list is receiving the highly generous incentives (say, $5 million annually) for working properly, and

* when each Validator is competing with others very hard for being in the list in order to be receiving the highly generous incentives, and

* when any malicious Validator from the list cannot do anything wrong -- since it will be automatically dropped out of the list and replaced with a Validator from the waiting list, and

* when each Validator may also be dropped out of the list by users (Voters) through democratic voting (Competitive Quadratic Voting),

* <b>then the wide majority of (or all) Validators in the list will work properly, honestly,</b> and 

* <b>then 100 truly-decentralized (truly-autonomous) Validators are the sufficient condition for a blockchain to be considered truly-decentralized and sustainable.</b>

100 or 150, discussable.

The approach allows truly-decentralized and truly-democratic blockchains to be highly efficient, and simultaneously, highly sustainable.










<p>&nbsp</p>

**The Continuation**


<h1>9 &nbsp Highly Efficient True-Decentralization</h1>

*For reference,*

*During just one single year (2022), when the Bitcoin blockchain's market capitalizatin was on average just about $576 billion, nevertheless, the users of the Bitcoin blockchain paid the contributors (miners/validators), for keeping the blockchain working, an amount exceeding $10 billion.*

From day one, on the Vote blockchain, there the Highly Efficient True-Decentralization approach is used.

<p><i>
With this approach, even creating the highly generous incentives for Validators ($5m annually per person), the total annual budget for 100 Validators, even at a very high level of the blockchain's market capitalization of, say, $5 trillion, might be just about $500 million -- which is just 0.01% of the blockchain's market capitalization.

The Vote blockchain is more than <b>170 times (16,800.00%) more effective</b> than the Bitcoin blockchain and also many times more efficient than each of the existing blockchains, remaining truly-decentralized, truly-democratic and highly-sustainable.
</i>
 </p>



<h1>10 &nbsp Contributors</h1>

On the Vote Blockchain, there are 100 (up to 150) Contributors who can be contributing in the Vote blockchain, necessarily in two roles simultaneously: 

* as Validator, and 
* as Developer.

Each Contributor is a person (possibly anonymous) with their Public Address.

Each applicant (person, possibly anonymous) is appointed to the position of Contributor by users (Voters) through Competitive Quadratic Voting.

Each applicant (person, possibly anonymous) must find a way to prove their qualification and usefulness for the Vote blockchain and for this can use Hyde Park.

The first 100 persons (possibly anonymous) are appointed to the positions of Contributor by the Initiative Group.

Contributors may recieve donations from users (Voters).




<h1>11 &nbsp Automated Donations</h1>

Automated Donations are an element of a Creator Donation Culture.

On the Vote Blockchain, there are Automated Donations for donating tokens to people who are contributing in the Vote blockchain.

Automated Donations are an automated inbuilt feature of the Vote blockchain.

At the start, the monthly rate of Automated Donations is 0.05% from each public address's balance, and the donors (Voters) can monthly change the rate by 5%  – either increase or decrease –  through Competitive Quadratic Voting. 



<h1>12 &nbsp Voting System</h1>

The enormous benefit from voting, among others, is as follows,

**The more tokens are being locked for voting, the less tokens in real circulation.**

The Vote blockchain’s democratic system consists of the following elements:

* Competitive Quadratic Voting System (inbuilt)
* Hyde Park



<h1>13 &nbsp Competitive Quadratic Voting System</h1>

On the Vote blockchain, each voting on a proposal lasts 30 days (6,480,000 slots).

The "competitive" word means that on each proposal, the competitive Voters may place their bets simultaneously: some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

> The best decisions must overcome the Voting Power of rivals.

For example, while voting on a proposal — on appointing a certain person (Public Address) to the position of Contributor — some number of Voters may be placing their FOR bets, and simultaneously, some number of Voters may be placing their AGAINST bets.

The "quadratic" word, in its turn, means that the Voting Power of each bet is calculated as the square of the number of tokens.

For example, 

* if Voter’s bet is 1 Hand, the Voting Power of this bet is 1
* if Voter’s bet is 100 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 10
* if Voter’s bet is 1,000,000 Hands, the Voting Power of this bet is 1,000

and so on.

At the last slot (during each voting), the Voting Power of all the FOR bets are summarized and the Voting Power of all the AGAINST bets also are summarized.

Plus, each decision is made by a margin of at least 5% – in other words, the Mandatory Margin is 5%.

For example, if a vote on appointing a certain person (Public Address) to the position of Contributor has accumulated in total:

* FOR: 210,000,000,000 Voting Power<br>

* AGAINST: 180,000,000,000 Voting Power

then,

<p>the Voting Margin is 16.67%  &nbsp (210,000,000,000 / 180,000,000,000 - 1) * 100 = 16.67</p>

and,

16.67% > 5%.

Since the Voting Margin of 16.67% is more than the Mandatory Margin of 5%, the decision is made.


<h1>14 &nbsp Proposals</h1>

The Decisions are made on the following Proposals:

* on appointing a person (possibly anonymous) to the position of Contributor (100 positions)
* on dismissing a person (possibly anonymous) from the position of Contributor.
* on changing – either increasing or decreasing – the donation rate by 5%



<h1>15 &nbsp Hyde Park</h1>

Hyde Park is a set internet platforms for expressing various opinions and offering proposals, including, proposals on appointing/dismissing.





<p>&nbsp</p>

**To be continued a bit below...**


<h1 align="center">Hypotheses, Ideas</h1>


# About Technology

Thanks to good people, on the table, there already are technologies that are usable.

The hypothesis/idea is that we might take some existing blockchain technologies and combine them.

For example, we might take code of Solana blockchain itself (codebase) and combine it with code of some apps on the Solana blockchain, of course, modifying them a bit.



<p>&nbsp</p>

**The Continuation**

<p>&nbsp</p>
<h1>16 &nbsp Technology & Creator Donation Culture</h1>

At the start, the Vote blockchain uses the Solana blockchain's code modified a bit.

As an element of a Creator Donation Culture, we establish a new fete day — Creator Thanksgiving Day — on December 30th where people around the world may give their credits (thanks) to the most useful in-their-opinion creators of ideas and code through direct donations of tokens. 

Eventually, there might (will inevitably) be people who are searching for the creators eligible for donations, making the lists. 

One of the first names of such lists might be Anatoly Yakovenko.


<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>


As mentioned above, actually, in the industry, there are many more problems than described here, and probably each blockchain existing in 2023 deserves to go away since it cannot solve these problems.

All these problems can be solved only by truly-decentralized and truly-democratic blockchains, one of which, for example, the Vote blockchain is.
