<h1>1.2. &nbsp Endless Series of Errors in Science</h1>

As we can [see](https://github.com/sciZer0/7/tree/main/a), all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy – importantly, being fundamental – are absolutely wrong. Now, the wrongness of all these official formulas is a proven fact.

> ### The wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy is a proven fact.

But there is another fundamental errors:

* the official concept of Force
* the official concept of Work
* the official concept of Energy
* the official Law of conservation of Energy

All these fundamental errors together result in the endless series of errors in science.

<h1>2.1. &nbsp Work and Energy in the Most General Sense</h1>


In modern science, the whole logic about Work and Energy is absolutely wrong, so we need to start from the very beginning, from defining Work and Energy in the most general sense.

So.

Even official science considers that the Universe in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) on this work.

Importantly, I absolutely agree with this above.

Let’s call any system that can do Work “Organism”.

In its turn, a system is a collection of elements or components that function together.

*Of course, instead of the "Organism" word we might use the "System" word itself, the reason for the "Organism" choice will be clear a bit below.*

So, 

> **Organism is any system that can do Work.**

The New Definition of Work in the most general sense is:

> **Work is any activity of Organism that is spending Energy (resource).**

In short,

Work is any activity that is spending Energy (resource).

On the other hand, 

> **Energy is the resource for Organism to be doing Work.**

In short,

Energy is the resource to do Work.

And of course, 

> **Work and Energy have the same unit of measure.**




<br>
<h1>2.2. &nbsp New Law of Conservation of Energy & Free Energy</h1>

The current official law of Conservation of Energy is: 

*Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another.*

But it is possible for us to take free Energy from the nature — from the surrounding space.

The truth is that we people have been doing this for a long time.

We take free Energy in many cases, but it looks like people just don't understand this.

For example, when you breathe in the air you are taking free Energy from the environment — from the surrounding space. 

Say, every second your organism is spending a certain amount of Energy. Let’s take this amount as 100%. The thing is that about just 10% of this Energy your organism is taking from food (which might be not for free). And about 90% of this Energy your organism is taking for free from the environment  — through breathing.

This split can be whether 10% and 90%, or 5% and 95%, or other, I justdon't know exactly.

In order for you to try to understand how big is the share of this Energy that your organism evey second is taking for free through breathing, just think about the fact that a human can have been living without food for weeks, and just for seconds without breathing.

We also take free Energy when we use the sun, wind, hydro or thermal power stations, for example.

At some time point (in about 10 years or even much earlier) a solar panel can fully pay for itself and further, every moment next, can give us completely free Energy.

In this case, the solar panel is just a device/tool to take free Energy from the environment — from the surrounding space. At some time point, such a tool can fully pay for itself and further, every moment next, can give us completely free Energy.

And there is a lot of other examples.

Moreover, in general, the whole world's profit is only possible because we people can take free Energy in various forms, otherwise this all would be a zero-sum game.

Importantly, everything in general is a system.

Morw importantly,

* there are the Energy-Isolated Systems and Energy-Non-Isolated Systems

* often, people consider some systems as Energy-Isolated, but in reality, these systems are Energy-Non-Isolated.

* some devices/tools *– those that in reality aren't Energy-Isolated Systems but are Energy-Non-Isolated Systems, meaning can take in Energy from the surrounding space for free–* can work with an efficiency of more than 100%.

For example, an Electromagnet connected to an Electrical Source can additionally take in free Energy from the surrounding space and through this can work with an efficiency of more than 100%.

*More on this all below.*




<br>
<h1>2.3. &nbsp Concept of Organism and its Hand</h1>


Let's consider the 3 cases simultaneously:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/cases.png"/><br>
</p>

In Case #1, a human is holding the 20 kg object motionless in the air during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #2, the 20 kg object is free-falling during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #3, the 20 kg object is sitting motionless on the table during 30 seconds.<br>

What is happening in reality is the following:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/cases196.png"/><br>
</p>

In Case #1, a human is pushing upwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #2, the Universe is pushing downwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #3, the Universe is pushing downwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>

Let's call any system that can be pushing an object during a certain time “Organism” too.

> **Organism is any system that can be pushing an object during a certain time.**

In Case #1, Organism is a human (say, you).<br>
In Case #2 and Case #3, Organism is the Universe or, we might also say, some fragment of the Universe.

In each of the 3 cases,

Organism is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds by its "Hand".

In Case #1, Hand of Organism is the human's hand (say, your hand).<br>
In Case #2 and Case #3, Hand of Organism is Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand). 

Let's call the thing by which Organism is pushing an object "Hand".

> **Hand is Force, in other words: the thing by which Organism is pushing an object.**

So,

In Case #1, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #2, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #3, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>

In each of the 3 cases,

Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>




<br>
<h1>2.4. &nbsp Target for each Force</h1>

Each Force has its target.

For example, the target for Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) – while it is pushing an object – is to give the pushed object the downward Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²). 

Therefore, we can call this Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) “Target Acceleration” associated with the given Force, – Gravitational Force.

Target Acceleration is THE feature/attribute/characteristic of each Force.

Summarizing,

> ### Target Acceleration is the acceleration that Force, while it is pushing an object of a certain mass, is striving to give to the pushed object.




<br>
<h1>2.5. &nbsp New Formula for Force</h1>

The New Formula for Force is:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/Target.png"/><br>
</p>

where,<br>
F — Force pushing an object (Newton: N);<br>
m —  Mass of the pushed object (kilogram: kg);<br>
Target — Target for the given Force: Target Acceleration (meter/second²: m/s²)

Please pay attention that

the "Target" in the formula is namely Target Acceleration associated with the given Force, but <b>never</b> Real Acceleration of the pushed object.

In my opinion,

the New Formula for Force is exactly the true Newton's Formula for Force that he implyed.





<br>
<h1>2.6. &nbsp New Universal Formula for Work and Energy</h1>


The New Universal Formula for Work and Energy is:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/we.png"/><br>
</p>
where,<br>
W — Target Work of Organism associated with Force pushing an object (kg * m / s);<br>
E — Energy being spent on Target Work (kg * m / s);<br>
m — Mass of the pushed object (kg);<br>
Target — Target for the given Force: Target Acceleration (m/s²);<br>
t — Time of pushing the object (s).<br><br>


Please pay attention that

* the "Target" in the formula is namely Target Acceleration associated with the given Force, but <b>never</b> Real Acceleration of the pushed object;
* the formula doesn't result in zero when Real Acceleration of the pushed object is being equal to zero.






<br>
<h1>2.7. &nbsp New Concept of Force and Work</h1>


The magnitude of Force means the amountof Energy (resource/effort) that Organism is putting into the pushing for a second

In turn, the magnitude of Work just means the amount of Energy (resource/effort) that Organism is putting into the pushing for a certain number of seconds.




<br>
<h1>2.8. &nbsp New Unit of Measure for Work and Energy</h1>


I propose to name the new unit of measure for Work and Energy the “Energy”.

The Dimensional Formula for the “Energy” is as follows below:

“Energy” = Newton * second = kilogram * meter / second



<br>
<h1>2.9. &nbsp Static Mechanical Work</h1>



Let's again consider the 3 cases simultaneously:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/cases.png"/><br>
</p>

In more detail,

In Case #1, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during every moment of 30 seconds, applying the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.<br>
In Case #2, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during every moment of 30 seconds, applying the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.<br>
In Case #3, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during every moment of 30 seconds, applying the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.<br>

Extremely importantly, in each of the 3 cases, 

Organism, by its Hand, pushing the object during every moment of 30 seconds, with the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.

In other words,

In each of the 3 cases, Organism is putting the same effort/resource into the pushing during every moment.

Then, 

**Since in each of the 3 cases, during every moment Organism is putting the same effort into the pushing and we exactly know that in Case #2 Organism, doing the pushing, is spending its Energy (resource) on this Work, then it means that in Case 1# and Case #3, Organism, doing the pushing, is also spending its Energy (resource) on this Work.**

Moreover,

**Since in each of the 3 cases, during every moment Organism is putting the same effort into the pushing and we exactly know that in Case #2 Organism, doing the pushing, is doing Mechanical Work and is spending its Energy (resource) on this Work, then it means that in Case 1# and Case #3, Organism, doing the pushing, is also doing Mechanical Work (Static Mechanical Work) and is also spending its Energy (resource) on this Work.**

Bingo! Static Mechanical Work exists.

Please if you did not understand this "bold" thing above, read it again.

The New Concept of Work (Mechanical Work) is:

> ### Work (Mechanical Work) is the process where Organism, by its Hand applying a certain non-zero Force (effort/resource), is pushing an object during every moment of a certain time period.


The New Concept of Energy is:

> ### Energy is the resource for Organism to be pushing an object during every moment of a certain time period.

Now more on Work.

Any Work is the process of pushing, meaning any Work is Mechanical Work.

Any Work (Mechanical Work) is a push or combination of pushes.

Even though some of Works might probably not seem to someone that these are  pushes (Mechanical Work), in reality, any Work is a push or combination of pushes, meaning is Mechanical Work. I will give you just one example below.

The heating-up is also a combination of pushes, because any process of heating up an object is due to the increase in the velocities of particles inside the object. And the increase in the velocities of the particles occurs only because these particles are being pushed by some things ("Hands"). Therefore, any heating-up is a combination of pushes. And this means that the heating-up is Work and that Energy (some resource) is always being spent on this Work.

Importantly, there are Target Works and Non-Target Works.





<br>
<h1>2.10. &nbsp Target Works and Non-Target Works</h1>



Target Work is the Work that is the target for Organism to do while working.

Non-Target Work is any Work that isn't Target Work for Organism but is the Work that Organism must unavoidably do while doing Target Work.

In other words,

Non-Target Work is any Work that is additional but unavoidable for Organism to do while doing Target Work.

Work is additional but unavoidable for Organism.

For example, let's consider Work of a Linear Electric Motor (as an example of Organism).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/shaft.png"  height="200"><br>
  <i>Linear Electric Motor</i>
</p>

In this case:

* Target Work for Organism is to be pushing the shaft with a certain non-zero Force.

* Non-Target Work for Organism is to be heating up while doing Target Work

Importantly, even in a situation where the shaft, while being pushed by Hand, may be staying motionless (for example, being hold by your hand), Target Work is still being done by Organism and Energy (resource/effort) is being spent on Target Work.

For example, in Case #1, where a human is very very slowly lifting the 20 kg object:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/20up.png"><br>
</p>

* Target Work for Organism is to be pushing the 20 kg object upwards with a certain non-zero Force.

* Non-Target Work for Organism is to be heating up while doing Target Work

For example, in Case #2, where a human is holdingthe 20 kg object motionless in the air:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/20motionless.png"><br>
</p>

* Target Work for Organism is to be pushing the 20 kg object upwards with a certain non-zero orce.

* Non-Target Work for Organism is to be heating up while doing Target Work

Importantly, even in a situation where the 20 kg object, while being pushed by Hand, is staying motionless, Target Work is still being done by Organism and Energy (resource/effort) is being spent on Target Work.

As we can see,

Non-Target Work is the "inside" Work of Organism that Organism must unavoidably be doing inside itself in order to have the possibility of doing its Target Work.

The Universe as whole or each Organism separately works this way: each Target Work causes at least one Non-Target Work.

In other words,

Non-Target Work is unavoidable for Organism and the amount of Energy which is being spent on Non-Target Work is just the "additional energy-price" that Organism is unavoidably "paying" in order to have the possibility of doing its Target Work.

Of course, 

> ## not all of Energies are spent on (are converted to) Target Works. Those Energies that are spent on Non-Target Works, we consider our losses.

In Case #1, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds, applying, during each of the 30 seconds, the same non-zero Force equal to 196 Newtons.<br>

*More details on how to calculate each Force a bit below.*

> **Organism is any system that can, by its Hand, be pushing an outside object during each second of a sertain time period, applying, during each cecond, the same non-zero Force.

<h1>2.11. &nbsp New Undertanding about Force, Work and Energy</h1>



Force is the process where Organism, by its Hand, is pushing an outside object in a certain direction during one second, putting a certain non-zero amount of Energy (resource/effort) into the pushing.

The magnitude of Force means the amount of Energy (resource/effort) that Organism is putting into the pushing during one second of the pushing.

In its turn,

Work is the process where Organism, by its Hand, is pushing an outside object in a certain direction during a certain number of seconds, putting, for every second, a certain non-zero amount of Energy (resource/effort) equal to Force into the pushing.

The magnitude of Work means the amount of Energy (resource/effort) that Organism is putting into the pushing during a certain number of seconds.

More on Work.

Any Work is the process of pushing, meaning any Work is Mechanical Work, sometimes, Static Mechanical Work.

In other words,

Any Work (Mechanical Work) is a push or combination of pushes.

Even though some of Works might probably not seem to someone that these are  pushes (Mechanical Work), in reality, any Work is a push or combination of pushes, meaning is Mechanical Work. I will give you just one example below.

In other words, the truth is any of the following:

* the magnitude of Force means the amount of efforts that Organism is spending on the pushing for a second.
