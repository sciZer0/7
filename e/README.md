## FIRST OF ALL
Science now is a fundamentally illogical/wrong thing being taken on faith. The scientific system itself is much like a religious sect.

All I have is logic.

Some time ago, just through thinking logically about well-known facts, I made the biggest ever scientific discoveries.

The discoveries are so big that they directly affect philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, and eventually will change all science as we know it.

Simultaneously, the discoveries are very simple and obvious.

Note: Thanks to these discoveries, at best,<br>

* the world will have the ability to REALLY prosper;<br>

* people will become more financially secure, have more free time (less working time), and can significantly improve their lives, making them more fulfilled, happier and longer;<br>

* we as civilization will improve our understanding of the Universe and, in general, our thinking.


## BRIEF ABOUT

Some time ago, I made scientific discoveries about Force, Work and Energy that cardinally change/improve our understanding the Universe.

Among other things as a result I got the following:

New Formula for Force<br>
New Formula for Work<br>
New Formula for Energy<br>
New Formula for Power

Since Energy, as THE main resource for every event in the Universe, is the main concept in the chief sciences, the discoveries directly affect philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, and eventually will change all science as we know it.

Importantly, at the start of the process, I also discovered the existence of the biggest, LITERALLY-CRYING, logical mistakes in the very fundamentals of science that right now are strongly hindering the progress of our civilization.

Remarkably, the discoveries are fully based on well-known experiments and well-known Newton’s discoveries (1st, 2nd and 3rd Newton’s Laws) which, ATTENTION, were and still are not fully understood by people.

## BRIEF INTRODUCTION

In order for you to briefly get an idea of how big the whole wrongness of science is, here is a description of just 2 of the fundamental mistakes that I discovered.

#### THE 1st SUFFICIENT FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKE IN SCIENCE

This mistake is called "sufficient" because even this mistake alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe.

The mistake is based on the fact that science fails to even understand what is THE REAL REASON that a free-falling object during every second is moving the distance different in size.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/1.png"/><br>
  <i>We (people) know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments</i>
</p>

So, for example, science fails to even understand what is the real reason that a free-falling apple during every second is moving the distance different in size:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/2.png"/>
</p>

in particular, the apple is moving the shorter distance of 4.9 meters during the 1st second and the longer distance of 14.7 meters during the 2nd second.

The difference in the distances is 9.8 meters.

Unfortunately, science mistakenly believes that the real reason for the difference in the distances is Gravitational Force.

But the real reason IS NOT Gravitational Force.

The real reason for the difference in the distances is Inertia. 

But science absolutely fails to understand this.

As a consequence of the misunderstanding, for now, all scientists (all existing science textbooks) have the absolutely wrong concept of Work and hence have the absolutely wrong concept of Energy. As a result, all the existing formulas for calculating Work (W) and Energy (E), including these basic formulas,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/3.png"/>
</p>

are absolutely wrong.

The Joule, in its turn, is the absolutely wrong unit of measure for Work and Energy.

As said above, even this mistake alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe.

<i>The mistake is explained in detail below in this article.</i>

####  THE 2nd SUFFICIENT FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKE IN SCIENCE

This mistake is the same way called "sufficient" because it works the same way: even this mistake alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe.

The mistake is that in science, there the Concept of Static Mechanical Work is wrongly missing.

So, for example, the mistake results in the fact that

all scientists (all existing science textbooks), for now, CORRECTLY consider that the person on the left (lifting the 2 kg object upwards) is doing Mechanical Work and is spending their Energy (Resource) on this Work;

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/4.png"/>
</p>

BUT all scientists (all the existing science textbooks), for now, INCORRECTLY consider that the person on the right (holding the 20 kg object motionless in the air) is NOT DOING Mechanical Work and is NOT SPENDING their Energy (Resource) on this Work!

But in my opinion, the person on the right (holding the 20 kg object motionless in the air) is also doing Mechanical Work (Static Mechanical Work) and is spending their Energy (Resource) on this Work. And even moreover, the person on the right is doing a bigger amount of Mechanical Work than the person on the left is doing. Plus, the person on the right is spending a bigger amount of their Energy (Resource) on Mechanical Work than the person on the left is doing.

Due to this mistake — due to the Absence of the Concept of Static Mechanical Work in science — the vast majority of processes in the Universe right now are being fallen out of our sight, and hence understanding. For this reason, humanity has the absolutely wrong picture of the physical world and is losing gigantic opportunities.

As said above, even this mistake alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe.

<i>The Concept of Static Mechanical Work is explained in detail below in this article.</i>

Also, in science, there is a lot of other obvious fundamental mistakes. <i>More on it below.</i>

## BRIEF CONTEXT

As said above, there are the biggest, LITERALLY-CRYING, logical mistakes in the very fundamentals of science that right now are strongly hindering the progress of our civilization.

But how did we get there?

In my opinion, all the biggest fundamental mistakes in science occurred because people, as said above, didn’t and still don’t fully understand well-knwon Newton’s discoveries. Even though this might seem impossible, the fact of this misunderstanding is true.

<p align="center">

  <i>Isaac Newton: A Not-Fully-Understood Scientific Genius</i>
</p>

What about "official" science?

In my opinion, science now is a fundamentally illogical/wrong thing being taken on faith. And actually, the situation is even much worse than that, the scientific system itself is much like a religious sect.

The scientific system, precisely because of being much like a religious sect, is a fully-closed one. The system's entrance for any new person is ONLY possible on recommendations of members of the religious sect. But getting the recommendations (endorsements) is absolutely impossible when the person dares to say things that are logical but different from those that have been written in the religious books (somewhy called “textbooks”).

Moreover, the religious sect’s members always desperately cast stones at everyone who dares to say things that are logical but (yes, again) different from those that have been written in their religious books, and this is always so without allowing any open public discussion.

The today’s situation is that if any clever person wants to enter "official" science, first they must humiliate their own intellect, essentially they must DEGRADE their own intellect because the fundamental mistakes existing in "official" science are too big and obvious, it is impossible not to see them.

In my Open Letter to Elon Musk, I explain why exactly all "official" physics scientists around the world (including even those who privately agreed with these discoveries) publicly are, and will likely always be against an announcement of these discoveries (Spoiler: only because they have <b>personal reasons</b> for this).

## COMPULSORY PART

“OFFICIAL” CONCEPTS & FORMULAS

A. "Official" Concept of Force ("Official" Newton’s Formula for Force);<br>
B. "Official" Concept of Work and "Official" Concept of Energy.



## A. "Official" Concept of Force ("Official" Newton’s Formula for Force)

Foremost, before we start, it is important to understand that science considers that the Universe/Nature in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

Importantly, I absolutely agree with this above.

More detail on this we will be getting throughout the way.

Now, let’s start from the very beginning — from the "official" concept of Force.

Here is the most simple and simultaneously exact definition of Force:

<b>Force is a push.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/8.png"/><br>
</p>

In other words:

<b>Force is the process of pushing an object in a certain direction.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/9.png"/><br>
  <i>The green arrow shows the<br>
  direction of the pushing</i>
</p>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand creates a push (process of pushing), and it means your hand creates Force.

In other words:

<b>Force is when something is pushing an object.</b>

In the given case, your hand is pushing the wall.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand is pushing the wall</i>
</p>

It means your hand creates Force and, simply saying, your hand here is Force.

Now, let’s take, for example, Gravitational Force which is familiar to everyone.

But what is Gravitational Force?

>Remarkably, science doesn’t even attempt to answer: what is Gravitational Force? Everything modern science knows is that during every moment “something” is pushing every object closer to the ground, and we (people) call this “something” Gravitational Force.

For example, when you let an apple out of your hand,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/11.png"/><br>
</p>

the apple starts moving downwards (closer to the ground).

Importantly, the apple starts its motion downwards ONLY BECAUSE during every moment “something” is pushing (or , of course, if wanted, we might say "pulling" or "attracting") the apple downwards (closer to the ground). So when you let an apple out of your hand, the apple starts moving downwards.

In other words, during every moment, “something” is pushing the apple downwards and we (people) call this “something” Gravitational Force.

>Importantly, science does not know what is Gravitational Force.

And, as we already know, science considers that the Universe/Nature in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

So, for the sake of simplicity, Gravitational Force (F) might be imagined by us as the pushing done by a invisible hand  — by Invisible Hand of Big Organism.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/12.png"/><br>
  <i>The apple being pushed by<br>
     Invisible Hand (Gravitational Force)</i>
</p>

Metaphorically saying, Big Organism (the Universe) has its Invisible Hand and this Invisible Hand during every moment is pushing the apple downwards.

So, again for the sake of simplicity, we might always say that Gravitational Force (F) is Invisible Hand — Invisible Hand of Big Organism.

And now, we might already say that during every moment, Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing the apple downwards.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/13.png"/><br>
  <i>The apple being pushed by<br>
     Invisible Hand (Gravitational Force)</i>
</p>

Let’s repeat it once again, when you let an apple out of your hand, the apple starts moving downwards ONLY BECAUSE during every moment Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing the apple downwards.

But, for example, in cosmos far away from all planets, there is no Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) which could push every object downwards. So if you let an apple out of your hand, the apple won’t start moving downwards (won’t start moving anywhere).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/14.png"/><br>
</p>

On the other hand, on the Earth, as we already know, there is Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) which pushes every object downwards. So if you let an apple out of your hand, the apple starts its motion downwards only thanks to the pushing being done — during every moment —  by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand).

Summarizing, all that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) can EVER be doing during ANY moment of time is to be pushing an object downwards.

Here is the "official" Newton’s Formula for calculating Force,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/15.png"/><br>
</p>

where,<br>
F — Force pushing the object (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
m — Mass of the pushed object (measured in kilograms: kg);<br>
a — Real Acceleration of the pushed object during the given second (measured in meter/second²: m/s²); or, we might say, Real Increase in Velocity of the pushed object per the given second (measured in meter/second/second: m/s/s).

In my opinion, the true Newton’s Formula is different. <i>More on this a bit below.</i>

Only in some cases, the "official" formula for Force works correctly.

The formula is easier to understand through a simple example where a 20 kg object is free-falling.

CASE #1

So, let’s consider an example where a 20 kg object is free-falling during 30 seconds.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/16.png"/><br>
</p>

In this case, during every moment, Gravitational Force (Invisible hand) is pushing the 20 kg object downwards.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/17.png"/><br>
</p>

We want to calculate Force (Gravitational Force) pushing the 20 kg object.

ATTENTION: The "official" Newton’s formula for calculating Force works absolutely correctly in CASE #1.

Let’s take a close look at what is happening there, at what is going on.

So.

At the beginning of the 1st second of the free-falling, Velocity of this pushed 20 kg object (v) is 0 (m/s), and next the object starts free-falling.

Throughout the whole falling, Velocity of the pushed object (v) is increased uniformly, incl. uniformly during every second.

So at the beginning of the 2nd second of the free-falling, Velocity of the pushed object (v) becomes 9.8 (m/s).

We (people) know all these exact numbers about “free-falling“ by well-known experiments.

Next, 

at the beginning of the 3rd second, Velocity of the pushed object (v) becomes — 19.6 (m/s); 

at the beginning of the 4th second — 29.4 (m/s); 

at the beginning of the 5th second — 39.2 (m/s). 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/0.png"/><br>
  <i>We (people) know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments</i>
</p>

As we can see, during every second Velocity of the pushed 20 kg object is evenly increased by 9.8 (m/s).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/18.png"/><br>
  <i>We (people) know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments and simple<br>
   calculations</i>
</p>

So Real Increase in Velocity of the pushed object per ANY given second (<b>Δv</b>) is always the same,

<b>Δv</b> = <b>9.8</b> m/s per second;

or, in other words,

Real Acceleration of the pushed object during any given second (<b>a</b>) is always the same,

<b>a</b> = <b>9.8</b> m/s².

Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) pushing the 20 kg object downwards while free-falling can be correctly calculated through the "official" Newton’s Formula this way:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/19.png"/><br>
</p>

as the product of Mass of the pushed object, <b>m</b> (in our case, <b>m</b> = 20 kg) and Real Acceleration of the pushed object during any given second, <b>a</b> (in our case, <b>a</b> = 9.8 m/s²):

<b>F</b> = <b>20</b> (kg) * <b>9.8</b> (m/s²) = <b>196</b> (kg*m/s²) = <b>196</b> Newtons

or, in other words,

as the product of Mass of the pushed object, <b>m</b> (in our case, <b>m</b> = 20 kg) and Real Increase in Velocity of the pushed object per any given second, <b>Δv</b> (in our case, <b>Δv</b> = 9.8 m/s per second):

<b>F</b> = <b>20</b> (kg) * <b>9.8</b> (m/s/s) = <b>196</b> (kg*m/s/s) = <b>196</b> Newtons

As we can see, the unit of measure for Force is Newton.

In other words, Force is measured in Newtons.

Also, as we can see, the dimensional formula of Newton is,

Newton = kg*m / s²,

or

Newton = kg * m /s /s.

Now, we might say that Gravitational Force pushing downwards the 20 kg object is equal to <b>196</b> Newtons.

Or in other words, we might also say that Effort with which Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing downwards the 20 kg object is equal to <b>196</b> Newtons.

In addition, we might note that during ANY given second of this pushing (during ANY given second of this free-falling) the value of Force is always the same, <b>196</b> Newtons.

But if a 50 kg object is free-falling downwards during 30 seconds,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/20.png"/><br>
</p>

Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) pushing downwards this 50 kg object is already equal to 490 Newtons:

F = 50 (kg) * 9.8 (m/s²) = 490 Newtons

490 Newtons !

In this case, Gravitational Force is bigger.

This means that the more Mass of the pushed object, the more Gravitational Force pushing this object.

Now, we might say that while free-falling during every moment:

· the 20 kg object is being pushed by Force equal to 196 Newtons,

· the 50 kg object is being pushed by Force equal to 490 Newtons.

---

### B. "Official" Concept of Work and "Official" Concept of Energy

We already know that science considers that the Universe/Nature in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

Plus, "official" science thinks that the Universe (Big Organism) can do its work by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand).

Also, we know that in the vision of "official" science all that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) can EVER be doing during ANY given moment of time is to only be pushing an object downwards.

I absolutely agree with everything above.

With this all being held in mind, we go on.

Now let's consider the "Official" Concept of Work and "Official" Concept of Energy.

Both these concepts are easier to understand also through the  same CASE #1 familiar to us.

CASE #1

So, let’s again consider the example where the 20 kg object is free-falling during 30 seconds.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/16.png"/><br>
</p>

In this case, throughout any given moment, Gravitational Force (Invisible hand) is pushing the 20 kg object downwards.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/17.png"/><br>
</p>

>ATTENTION: The "official" Newton’s formula for Force works absolutely correctly in CASE #1.

Let’s take again a closer look at what is happening there — at what is going on.

So.

As we already know, during any given second Velocity of the pushed 20 kg object is evenly increased by 9.8 (m/s).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/18.png"/><br>
  <i>We (people) know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments and simple<br>
   calculations</i>
</p>


Importantly,during every moment Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing the 20 kg object downwards and ONLY AS A RESULT of that pushing, the pushed object starts moving downwards and is increasing its velocity uniformly during every second.

The Distance (D) moved by the pushed object during any given second is as follows:  

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/21.png"/><br>
  <i>We (people) know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments and simple<br>
   calculations</i>
</p>

Please pay attention to Summary Distance (D) — the right column.

Distance (D) during the 1st second is 4.9 meters;<br>
Distance (D) during the 2nd second is 14.7 meters;<br>
Distance (D) during the 3rd second is 24.5 meters;<br>
Distance (D) during the 4th second is 34.3 meters;<br>
Distance (D) during the 5th second is 44.1 meters.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/22.png"/><br>
  <i>We (people) know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments</i>

So what is Work in the vision of "official" science?

"Official" science says that while the free-falling of the 20 kg object, during every second, the Universe (Big Organism) is doing Work by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand), pushing the 20 kg object downwards. 

And I absolutely agree with this above.

But I don’t agree with the "official" formula by which "official" science calculates Work:

W = F * D

where,<br>
W — Work done by Force during the given second (measured in Joules: J);<br>
F — Force pushing the object during the given second (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
D — Distance moved by the pushed object during the given second (measured in meters: m).

Since during any given second Force (Gravitational Force) is the same, 196 Newtons (196 N); and since during any given  second the pushed 20 kg object is moving the distance different in size, "official" science says the following:

Work being done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand)

during the 1st second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 4.9 (m) = 960.4 Joules

during the 2nd second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 14.7 (m) = 2881.2 Joules

during the 3rd second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 24.5 (m) = 4802.0 Joules

during the 4th second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 34.3 (m) = 6722.8 Joules

during the 5th second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 44.1 (m) = 8643.6 Joules

ATTENTION: "Official" science states that while free-falling

the more Distance (D) traveled by the object during the given second, the more Work is done by the same Gravitational Force during the given second.

This statement above is absolutely wrong and this is explained in Discovery #1.
  
Now about Energy.

"Official" science says that while free-falling of the 20 kg object, during any given second the Universe (Big Organism), while doing Work, is spending some Energy (resource) of the Universe (Big Organism) on this Work.  

And I also absolutely agree with this above.

But I don’t agree with the "official" formula by which "official" science calculates Energy:
  
E = F * D

where,<br>
E — Energy (Resource) being spent by the subject pushing the object during the given second (measured in Joules: J);<br>
F — Force pushing the object during every second (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
D — Distance moved by the pushed object during the given second (measured in meters: m).
  
<i>For example, as the subject this might be you (your Hand) or the Universe (Invisible Hand).</i>

Since during any given second Force (Gravitational Force) is the same, 196 Newtons (196 N); and since during every second the pushed 20 kg object is moving the distance different in size, "official" science says the following:

Energy (Resource) being spent by the Universe on Work

during the 1st second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 4.9 (m) = 960.4 Joules

during the 2nd second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 14.7 (m) = 2881.2 Joules

during the 3rd second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 24.5 (m) = 4802.0 Joules

during the 4th second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 34.3 (m) = 6722.8 Joules

during the 5th second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 44.1 (m) = 8643.6 Joules

ATTENTION: "Official" science states that while free-falling 

the more Distance (D) traveled by the object during the given second, the more Energy (Resource) is being spent by the Universe during the given second.

This statement above is absolutely wrong and this is explained in Discovery #1

Summarizing, "Official" science states that

W = E = F * D

This formula above is absolutely wrong and this is explained in Discovery #1.

>ATTENTION: In my opinion, the "Official" Formula of Work and the "Official" Formula of Energy are absolutely wrong.

As we can see:

science (mistakenly in my opinion) believes that the real reason for the difference in the distance is Gravitational Force —  the more Work is done by the same Gravitational Force during the given second, the more Distance (D) traveled by the object during the given second.

## 1.1. First Fundamental Mistake in "Official" Science

This First Fundamental Mistake is SUFFICIENT.

Even this single mistake is sufficient, it destroys the whole concept of science of understanding the Universe.

As said above, in my opinion, all the biggest basic mistakes in science occurred because people didn’t and still don’t fully understand the three Newton’s discoveries (Newton’s 1st, 2nd and 3rd Laws) which results, among other things, in misunderstanding of what in reality is Force, Work and Energy.

In particular, "official" science fails to understand the difference between how Inertia works and how Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) works; and especially, what happens when they (Inertia and Gravitational Force) work simultaneously.

In this chapter, along the way, we will see the total wrongness of "official" science: 

the total wrongness of the "official" formulas for calculating Work (W) and Energy (E).

In order to fully understand this, let’s recall some familiar stuff above, adding some new points.

When you let an apple out of your hand,

this apple starts moving downwards (closer to the ground).

Importantly, this apple starts its motion downwards ONLY BECAUSE during every moment Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing this apple downwards (closer to the ground).

In cosmos far away from all planets, there is no Gravitational Force (no Invisible Hand) that is pushing every object downwards. So if you let an apple out of your hand, the apple won’t start moving downwards (won’t start moving anywhere).

But on the Earth, on the other hand, there is Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) that is pushing every object downwards. So if you let an apple out of your hand, the apple starts its motion downwards only thanks to the pushing done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand).

Now, let’ learn how Inertia works.

For example, in cosmos far away from all planets, while you hold an apple in your hand, this apple has zero Velocity (v = 0 m/s) . But if you throw the apple in any certain direction (for example,  upwards vertically),

this apple, at the moment of separation from your hand, will have some accumulated non-zero Velocity (say, 10 m/s ); and every moment next, after the separation from your hand, this apple will be moving at this accumulated Velocity (10 m/s) (theoretically, can be moving forever).

The apple can  be moving at this accumulated Velocity (10 m/s) FOREVER!

We might also call this accumulated Velocity “Inertial Velocity”.

Extremely importantly, the apple can/will be moving at this accumulated Velocity (Inertial Velocity) forever ONLY because of Inertia (only thanks to Inertia, only due to Inertia, only by Inertia).

In other words, this apple can be being moved ONLY by Inertia. Even solely Inertia can be moving this apple during very long time, for example, centuries.

According to Newton’s 1st Law, a body at rest tends to stay at rest, and a body in motion tends to stay in motion, unless acted on by a net external force.

Importantly, for Newton, steady motion in a straight line is the same as being at rest.

It means that when the apple is being moved by Inertia at Inertial Velocity this is the same as when the apple is being at rest.

ATTENTION: Newton’s 1st Law means that no Force (no push) is needed for the apple while being moved by Inertia at Inertial Velocity!

So no Work is being done by the Universe and no Energy is being spent by the Universe when the apple is being moved by Inertia at Inertial Velocity, according to Newton’s 1st Law.

And now, let’s go back to our familiar CASE #1 when the 20 kg object is free-falling  during 30 seconds.

Let’s analyze this case in detail.

So, the question is what is THE REAL REASON that this free-falling 20 kg object during every second is moving the distance different in size.

In particular, the 20 kg object is moving the shorter distance of 4.9 meters during the 1st second and the longer distance of 14.7 meters during the 2nd second.

The difference in the distances is 9.8 meters, — 14.7 (m) - 4.9 (m) = 9.8 m.

Moreover, the difference in the distances is always the same, 9.8 meters:

14.7 (m) - 4.9 (m) = 9.8 m24.5 (m) - 14.7 (m) = 9.8 m34.3 (m) - 24.5 (m) = 9.8 m44.1 (m) - 34.3 (m) = 9.8 mand so on.

"Official" science wrongly believes that this difference in the distances (9.8 m) is due to the different-in-size Work that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is doing during every second.

Unfortunately, "official" science is absolutely wrong.

And right now I will give you the explanation of what is the real reason for this difference in the distances.

Please extremely carefully study this table below describing the free-falling of an object (the 20 kg object or apple) during every second  (5 seconds in total) — especially the Inertial Distance (D2) moved by the object during every single second (red-colored column).

Pay attention to:

—  Increase in Velocity per any given second (Δv) is the same — 9.8 m/s per second;

—  Velocity (v) accumulated by the pushed object at the beginning of any given second is precisely Inertial Velocity of the object at the beginning of the given second;

— Inertial Distance (D2) is the distance being moved by the object during any given second only due to Inertia  — i.e. not due to Push (Work) of Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second, but due to Inertia.

The whole thing is that while free-falling the pushed object during every single second is moving Summary Distance (D) as the sum (as the result of the sum) of the two absolutely different sorts of distances, D1 and D2:

D1 is Non-Inertial Distance being moved by the object due to the pushing done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) , i.e. precisely due to Work of Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second;

D2 is the Inertial Distance being moved by the object due to Inertia  — i.e. not due to the pushing (Work) of Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second, but only due to Inertia.

====

Here Isaac Newton comes into play again, again with his 1 Law.

According to Newton’s 1st Law, when an object is moving only by inertia, then no Work is being done and no Energy (no resource) is being spent in this process — because when an object is moving only by inertia it is the same that the object is being at rest.

In particular, the wrongness of science  lies in misunderstanding the fact that in every “free-falling” there is also the Inertial motion being moved by the object due only to inertia (i.e. not due to Work of Gravitational Force, but only due to Inertia).

It all means that when the object is moving the Inertial Distance (D2) during every single second of free-falling, no Work is being done and no Energy (no resource) is being spent.

=====

Now, let’s consider, for example, the 1st second of this free-falling — in the table it is the “1st second of fall” line (green-colored line).

Importantly, during the 1st second of the free-falling, the object is moving Summary Distance (D) as the sum (as the result of the sum) of the two absolutely different sorts of distances, D1 and D2:

In detail:

D1 is Non-Inertial Distance being moved by the object due to pushing the object by Gravitational Force (i.e. due to Push (Work) of Gravitational Force during the 1st second) — note that Non-Inertial Distance (D1) is the same (4.9 m) during every single second

D1 = AddedVelocity/2 * t = Δv/2 * t = 9.8 (m/s) / 2 * 1 (s) = 4.9 meters

D2 is Inertial Distance — since at the beginning of the 1st second the object hadn’t accumulated any Velocity (v = 0 m/s), it means that during the 1st second the object wasn’t moving inertially (by inertia)

D2 = v * t = 0 (m/s) * 1 (s) = 0 meters

So Summary Distance (D) during the 1st second is:

D = D1 + D2 = 4.9 (m) + 0 (m) = 4.9 meters

And now, let’s consider the 2nd second of this free-falling — in the table it is the “2nd second of fall” line (green-colored line).

Importantly, during the 2nd second of the free-falling, the object is also moving Summary Distance (D) as the sum (as the result of the sum) of the two absolutely different sorts of distances, D1 and D2:

In detail:

D1 is Non-Inertial Distance being moved by the object due to pushing the object by Gravitational Force (i.e. due to Push (Work) of Gravitational Force during the 2nd second) — note that Non-Inertial Distance (D1) is the same (4.9 m) during every single second

D1 = AddedVelocity/2 * t = Δv/2 * t = 9.8 (m/s) / 2 * 1 (s) = 4.9 meters

D2 is the Inertial Distance being moved by the object due to Inertia during the 1st second  — i.e. not due to the pushing (Work) of Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the 1st second, but only due to Inertia

Inertial Velocity is equal to Accumulated Velocity at the beginning of the 2nd second, v:

D2 = v * t = 9.8 (m/s) * 1 (s) = 9.8 meters

Importantly, if at the beginning of the 2nd second we turned off the Gravitational Force, the object anyway would be moving at Inertial Velocity (9.8 m/s) during the entire 2nd second and on.

So Summary Distance (D) during the 2nd second is:

D = D1 + D2 = 4.9 (m) + 9.8 (m) = 14.7 meters

According to Newton’s 1st Law, when an object is moving only by inertia (D2), then no Work is being done and no Energy (no resource) is being spent in this process (because when an object is moving only by inertia it is the same thing that the object is being at rest).

Since the Inertial Distance (D2 = 9.8 meters) during the 2nd second is absolutely irrelevant to the pushing done by Gravitational Force during the 2nd second (i.e. is irrelevant to the Work (W) of Gravitational Force during the 2nd second), then the Inertial Distance (D2 = 9.8 meters) should not increase the calculated Work (W) of Gravitational Force during the 2nd second and the calculated Energy (E) .

But in this wrong "official" formula for Work and Energy:

the Inertial Distance (D2) is mistakenly included in the calculation and hence mistakenly increases the wrongly calculated Work (W) of Gravitational Force (F) during the 2nd second and therefore mistakenly increases the wrongly calculated Energy (E).

It is important to understand that the same thing happens during every single second of the falling (please study the table above carefully)!

And this all means that the base "official" formula for Work and Energy:

is absolutely wrong!

And once again,

it’s extremely important to understand that DURING EVERY SINGLE SECOND of “free-falling” the same Energy is required to do the same Work — to increase Velocity of the pushed object by the same value of 9.8 m/s.

Also, it is very important to understand that this wrong "official" formula for Work and Energy is base and thus strictly defines all other “official formulas“, incl. the "official" formula for potential Energy (Ep) and the "official" formula for kinetic Energy (Ek):

which means that these "official" formulas for potential Energy (Ep) and kinetic Energy (Ek):

are also absolutely wrong!

This means that all of the "Official" Formulas for Work and Energy, while using them for calculations, literally generate nonsense.

And since all these wrong formulas also strictly define the dimensional formulas of the Joule (Joule =Newton*meter = kilogram*meter²/second²), it all means that the Joule is the absolutely wrong unit of measure for Work and Energy!

And, of course, this all means the total wrongness to use the Joule as the unit of measure for Work and Energy!

So.

The real reason for this difference in the distances IS NOT Gravitational Force.

The real reason for this difference in the distances IS Inertia.

Unfortunately, "official" science absolutely fails to understand this.

As a consequence of this misunderstanding, for now, all scientists (all existing science textbooks) have the absolutely wrong concept of Work and hence have the absolutely wrong concept of Energy. As a result, all the existing formulas for Work (W) and Energy (E), including these basic formulas,

are absolutely wrong and, when using them for calculations of Work or Energy, generate nonsense.

The Joule, in its turn, is the absolutely wrong unit of measure for Work and Energy.

Always when we are calculating Work or Energy in Joules we get nonsense.

Since concepts of Work and Energy are basic in science, even due to this single fundamental mistake, there is the total incorrectness of "official" science.

CONCLUSIONS

This discovered mistake (error) is absolutely sufficient proof of the total incorrectness of all the "Official" Formulas for Work and Energy, and is absolutely sufficient proof of the total wrongness to use any of these formulas for any calculations of Work or Energy.

This mistake is fundamental. LITERALLY-CRYING.

Of course, this discovered mistake (error) automatically cancels all the "Official" Formulas for Work and Energy, and also the Joule as the unit of measure for Work and Energy!

Importantly, even this single discovered mistake destroys all "official" science.

__________

As said above, even this single mistake described/explained above destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe.

This mistake is sufficient.
