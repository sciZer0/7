# Open Letter to Elon Musk

Hello Elon!

I am a science enthusiast.

My support to all of your efforts.

Elon, I ask you to help civilization, please do this once again.

## The point in short

All I have is logic.

Some time ago, just through thinking logically about well-known facts, I made new scientific discoveries about Force, Work and Energy that cardinally change/improve our understanding the Universe.

Among other things as a result I got the following:

* New Formula for Force
* New Formula for Work
* New Formula for Energy
* New Formula for Power

Since Energy, as THE main resource for every event in the Universe, is the main concept in the chief sciences, these discoveries directly affect philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, and eventually will change all science as we know it.

Importantly, at the start of the process, I also discovered the existence of the biggest, LITERALLY-CRYING, logical mistakes in the very fundamentals of science that right now are strongly hindering the progress of our civilization.

Remarkably, the discoveries are fully based on well-known experiments and well-known Newton’s discoveries (1st, 2nd and 3rd Newton’s Laws) which, ATTENTION, were and still are not fully understood by people.

Here is the main article,<br>

<b>New Discoveries Changing All Science</b><br>
https://github.com/sciZer0/newdiscoveries/tree/main/a

Although there are 2 problems, social and engineering.

## The Social Problem

<i>Here I explain why exactly all “official” physics scientists around the world (including even those who privately agreed with these discoveries) publicly are and will likely always be against an announcement of these discoveries (Spoiler: only because they have <b>personal reasons</b> for this).</i>

The social problem is that every “official” physicist around the world, including every Nobel laureate, is not interested in an announcement of these discoveries.

This is so because the first thing that the “official” scientists have to do is to admit their own complete incompetence, since the new fundamental discoveries are extremely simple and obvious but it turns out that for all that time the “scientists” have been unable to see those obvious biggest basic mistakes that exist in modern physics. It is an impossibly shameful situation for them in general and for every physics scientist in particular. 

So for this <b>personal reason</b>, every “official” physicist around the world is not interested in an announcement of the discoveries.

Additionally, many “official” physics scientists are afraid because of understanding of how many things, thanks to the discoveries, will unavoidably have to be changed in physics and the scientific organizational system itself. And for this reason, they are worrying about losing their current power and monopoly (at least, about losing their current status quo). 

This is another personal reason on why the “official” physics scientists around the world are not interested in an announcement of the discoveries.

In my opinion, “official” science is a religion being taken on faith. Actually, the situation is even much worse than that, the scientific system itself is a religious sect.

In reality, the scientific system being a religious sect is a fully-closed one. For any new person, the entrance in the system is ONLY possible on recommendations of members of the religious sect. But getting the recommendations (endorsements) is absolutely impossible when the person dares to say things that are logical but different from those that have been written in the religious books (somewhy called “textbooks”).

Moreover, the religious sect’s members always desperately cast stones at everyone who dares to say things that are logical but (yes, again) different from those that have been written in their religious books, and this is always so without allowing any open public discussion.

The today’s situation is that if any clever person wants to enter “official” science, first they must humiliate their own intellect, essentially they must DEGRADE their own intellect because the fundamental mistakes existing in “official” science are too big and obvious, it is impossible not to see them.

As said above, all I have is logic. I do not have any official science degree and do not work at any science institution; so Science, Cell, Nature and even the new open-access platforms like ScienceMatters, eLife, arXiv and IOPscience are closed to me.

In my home country I have made new acquaintances who had friends who are physics academics. So these physics academics eventually got acquainted with the discoveries and completely agreed with them. But they (these physics academics) right now are afraid of admitting it publicly for the reasons mentioned above and ask not to mention their names.

In personal conversations, all those physicists (including those academics) who completely agreed with these discoveries have said that, in their opinion, no single “official” physics scientist in the world will ever help an announcement of these discoveries, — and even more than that: they will be against these discoveries and me.

At the current time, I have written thousands of letters to professors of the world’s famous universities. No answer so far.

So now there is this large social problem about the announcement of these discoveries.

Elon I believe you are different and have the courage to publicly admit the existence of the biggest, LITERALLY-CRYING, logical mistakes in the very fundamentals of science that right now are strongly hindering the progress of our civilization.

## The Engineering Problem

One of these discoveries is that I have discovered the ability of Magnets (Electromagnets and Permanent Magnets) to take in Energy from the environment — from the surrounding space.

As a result, we can multiply Electric Energy with a very high efficiency.

We can take lots of lots of free clean Energy.

EEMG is the Next-Generation Generator of Electrical Energy.

</p>

<i>In my opinion, today all existing Electric Generators and Electric Motors (which have Electromagnets and work on the principle of Electromagnetic Induction) have one common construction mistake that does not allow them to work with an efficiency of more than 100%.</i>

EEMG is the Next Generation Electric Generator that works with an efficiency of much more than 100%.

Now I have all the necessary data, including the data from reputable international sources, and I absolutely know how to make the Electrical Energy Multiplier-Generator (EEMG) which multiplies Electrical Energy with an efficiency of much more than 100%, and this huge Energy can be stored or consumed.

The engineering problem is that the EEMG making requires very high technologies so I on my own cannot make any EEMG model to demonstrate. I absolutely know how to make EEMG but I myself most likely cannot make it.

EEMGs can also be used on the BFR and Mars.

About patenting EEMG

Importantly, I don’t want to patent EEMG. I just want my discoveries to get the world’s attention and then I will share my knowledge about making NGEGs with the world for free. This way no one will have an advantage over others. All people (incl. all businesses) will be in equal conditions to freely start making myriads of EEMGs and so civilization will get the powerful push for the accelerated progress.

______

Now I send the information about the discoveries, in addition to physics scientists, to scientists from other fields and plus to this, opinion leaders (including writers, publicists, journalists, bloggers).

These discoveries highly need to be commonly known.

Elon please conduct your own research and investigation (I will answer all questions and am ready for any open public discussion), help announce the discoveries to advance all science on the planet and cardinally accelerate the advent of sustainable Energy on Earth and Mars.

Help civilization.
