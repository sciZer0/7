## FIRST OF ALL
This paper shows that science now is a fundamentally illogical/wrong thing taken on faith, and that the scientific system itself is exactly a religious sect.

I am just a person on the globe and all I have is logic.

The whole thing is that some time ago, just through thinking logically about well-known facts, I made the biggest ever scientific discoveries.

The discoveries are so big that they directly affect philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, and eventually will change/improve all science as we know it.

Simultaneously, the discoveries are very simple and obvious.

## EASY TO UNDERSTAND

This paper explaining the discoveries was written in such a way as to be understandable to everyone.

In particular, if you know the multiplication table and can understand these simple mathematical examples:

2 * 2 = 4<br>
20 * 9.8 = 196<br>
8 / 2 = 4<br>
9.8 / 2 * 1 = 4.9

you are fully able to easily understand every thing, even if you have no scientific background.

Throughout the whole paper, I practice "redundancy of understandability", using very simple language and sometimes explaining the same things several times and in various ways.

Feel free to ask me any questions about the discoveries: thescizer0@gmail.com.

<i>By the way, English is my second language, I started learning it by myself when I was 39 and made the discoveries when I was 45.</i>

## ABOUT DISCOVERIES

Some time ago, I made scientific discoveries about Force, Work and Energy that cardinally change/improve our understanding of the Universe.

As a result, among other things, I got the following:

* New Formula for Force<br>
* New Formula for Work<br>
* New Formula for Energy<br>
* New Formula for Power<br>

Since Energy, as THE main resource for every event in the Universe, is the main concept in the chief sciences, the discoveries, as said above, directly affect philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, and eventually will change all science as we know it.

Importantly, at the start of the process, I also discovered the existence of the biggest, LITERALLY-CRYING, logical errors in the very fundamentals of science that right now are strongly hindering the progress of our civilization.

Remarkably, the discoveries are fully based on well-known experiments and well-known Newton’s discoveries (1st, 2nd and 3rd Newton’s Laws) which, ATTENTION, were and still are not fully understood by people.

At best, thanks to the discoveries,<br>

* the world will get unlimited access to new clean energy and the ability to REALLY prosper;<br>

* people will become more financially secure, have more free time (less working time), and can significantly improve their lives, making them more fulfilled, happier and longer;<br>

* we as civilization will improve our understanding of the Universe and, in general, our thinking.





## FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS IN SCIENCE

<i>This chapter is mostly for experts, so if you are a normal person you might just skip it and go straight to the next chapter called CONTEXT</i>

In order for you to get an idea of how big the whole wrongness of science is, here is a description of just 2 of the fundamental errors that were discovered.

#### ONE OF SUFFICIENT FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS IN SCIENCE

This error is called "sufficient" because even this error alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe. This error is sufficient.

The error is based on the fact that science fails to even understand what is THE REAL REASON that a free-falling object during every second is moving the distance different in size.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/1.png"/><br>
  <i>We people know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments</i>
</p>

*For non-experts it is important to keep in mind that when we people consider Gravitational Force (Work of Gravitational Force) and Free-Falling in general, we do not take into account the air resistance.*

For example, science fails to even understand what is the real reason that a free-falling apple during every second is moving the distance different in size.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/2.png"/>
</p>

In particular, the apple is moving the shorter distance of 4.9 meters during the 1st second and the longer distance of 14.7 meters during the 2nd second.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/1.png"/><br>
  <i>We people know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments</i>
</p>

The difference in the distances is 9.8 meters (14.7 - 4.9 = 9.8).

Unfortunately, science mistakenly believes that the real reason for the difference in the distances is Gravitational Force -- Work of Gravitational Force.

But the real reason is not Gravitational Force  -- not Work of Gravitational Force.

The real reason of the difference in the distances is Inertia. 

But modern science absolutely fails to understand this.

As a consequence of the misunderstanding, for now, all scientists (all existing science textbooks) have the absolutely wrong concept of Work and hence have the absolutely wrong concept of Energy. As a result, all the existing formulas for calculating Work (W) and Energy (E), including these basic formulas,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/3.png"/>
</p>

are absolutely wrong.

The Joule, in its turn, is the absolutely wrong unit of measure for Work and Energy.

As said above, even this fundamental error alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe. This error is sufficient.

<i>The error is explained in detail below.</i>

#### ANOTHER SUFFICIENT FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN SCIENCE

This error is the same way called "sufficient" because it works the same way: even this error alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe. This error is sufficient.

The error is that in science, there the Concept of Static Mechanical Work is wrongly missing.

So, for example, the error results in the fact that

all scientists (all existing science textbooks), for now, CORRECTLY consider that the person on the left (lifting the 2 kg object upwards) is doing Mechanical Work and is spending their Energy (Resource) on this Work;

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/4.png"/>
</p>

BUT at the same time, all scientists (all the existing science textbooks), for now, INCORRECTLY consider that the person on the right (holding the 20 kg object motionless in the air) is NOT DOING Mechanical Work and is NOT SPENDING their Energy (Resource) on this Work!

But in my opinion, the person on the right (holding the 20 kg object motionless in the air) is also doing Mechanical Work (Static Mechanical Work) and is also spending their Energy (Resource) on this Work. Moreover, the person on the right is doing a bigger amount of Mechanical Work than the person on the left. Plus, the person on the right is spending a bigger amount of their Energy (Resource) on Mechanical Work than the person on the left.

Due to this fundamental error — due to the Absence of the Concept of Static Mechanical Work in science — the vast majority of processes in the Universe right now have been falling out of our sight, and hence understanding. For this reason, humanity has the absolutely wrong picture of the physical world and is losing gigantic opportunities.

As said above, even this fundamental error alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe. This error is sufficient.

<i>The Concept of Static Mechanical Work is explained in detail below.</i>

Also, in science, there is a lot of other fundamental errors which are obvious. <i>More on this below.</i>

**Importantly, with all the official formulas for Energy that are wrong, in fact for now, our civilization doesn't even understand what Energy is.**


## CONTEXT

As said above, there are the biggest, LITERALLY-CRYING, logical errors in the very fundamentals of science that right now are strongly hindering the progress of our civilization.

But how did we get there?

In my opinion, all the biggest fundamental errors in science occurred because people, as said above, didn’t and still don’t fully understand well-knwon Newton’s discoveries. Even though this might seem impossible, the fact of this misunderstanding is true.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/5.png"/><br>
  <i>Isaac Newton: A Not-Fully-Understood Scientific Genius</i>
</p>

What about official science?

In my opinion, modern science is a fundamentally illogical/wrong thing taken on faith and the scientific system itself is exactly a religious sect.

Specifically, the entire scientific system, because of being exactly a religious sect, is a fully-closed one. The entrance in the system for any new person is ONLY possible on recommendations of members of the religious sect. But receiving those "needed" recommendations (endorsements) is absolutely impossible for any new person when the person dares to say things that are logical but different from those that have been written in the religious books (somewhy called “textbooks”).

Moreover, the religious sect’s members always desperately cast stones at everyone who dares to say things that are logical but (yes, again) different from those that have been written in their religious books, – importantly, and this is always so without allowing any open public discussion.

The today’s situation is that if any clever person wants to enter official science, the first thing that the person must do is that this person must humiliate their own intellect, essentially they must DEGRADE their own intellect because the fundamental errors existing in official science are too big and obvious, and it is impossible to not see them.

In my Open Letter to Elon Musk, I explain why exactly all official physics scientists around the world (including even those who privately agreed with these discoveries) publicly are, and will likely always be against an announcement of these discoveries (Spoiler: only because they have <b>personal reasons</b> for this).

## A. Official Concept of Force

Foremost, before we start, it is important to understand that official science considers that the Universe/Nature in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

Importantly, I absolutely agree with this above.

More detail on this we will be getting throughout the way.

Now, let’s start from the very beginning — from the official concept of Force.

Here is the most simple and simultaneously exact definition of Force:

<b>Force is a push.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/8.png"/><br>
</p>

In other words:

<b>Force is a process of pushing an object in a certain direction.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/9.png"/><br>
  <i>The green arrow shows the<br>
  direction of the pushing</i>
</p>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand creates a push (process of pushing), and it means your hand creates Force. Simply put, your pushing hand here is Force.

In other words:

<b>Force is when something is pushing an object.</b>

In the given case, your hand is pushing the wall.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand is pushing the wall</i>
</p>

Now, let’s take, for example, Gravitational Force which is familiar to everyone.

But what is Gravitational Force?

>Remarkably, science doesn’t even attempt to answer: what is Gravitational Force? All that modern science knows is that during every moment “something” is pushing every object closer to the ground, and we (people) call this “something” Gravitational Force.

For example, when you let an apple out of your hand,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/11.png"/><br>
</p>

the apple starts moving downwards (closer to the ground).

Importantly, the apple starts its motion downwards ONLY BECAUSE during every moment “something” is pushing (or , of course, if wanted, we might say "pulling" or "attracting") the apple downwards (closer to the ground). So when you let an apple out of your hand, the apple starts moving downwards.

In other words, during every moment, “something” is pushing the apple downwards and we (people) call this “something” Gravitational Force.

>Importantly, science does not know what Gravitational Force is.

And, as we already know, science considers that the Universe/Nature in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

So, for the sake of simplicity, Gravitational Force (F) might be imagined by us as the pushing done by a invisible hand  — by Invisible Hand of Big Organism.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/12.png"/><br>
  <i>The apple being pushed by<br>
     Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand)</i>
</p>

Metaphorically saying, Big Organism (the Universe) has its Invisible Hand and this Invisible Hand during every moment is pushing the apple downwards.

So, again for the sake of simplicity, we might always say that Gravitational Force (F) is Invisible Hand — Invisible Hand of Big Organism.

And now, we might already say that during every moment, Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing the apple downwards.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/13.png"/><br>
  <i>The apple being pushed by<br>
     Invisible Hand (Gravitational Force)</i>
</p>

So, when you let an apple out of your hand, the apple starts moving downwards ONLY BECAUSE during every moment Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing the apple downwards.

But, for example, in cosmos far away from all planets, there is no Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) which could push every object downwards. So if you let an apple out of your hand, the apple won’t start moving downwards (won’t start moving anywhere).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/14.png"/><br>
</p>

On the other hand, on the Earth, as we already know, there is Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) which pushes every object downwards. So if you let an apple out of your hand, the apple starts its motion downwards only thanks to the pushing being done — during every moment —  by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand).

Summarizing, all that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) can EVER be doing during ANY moment of time is to be pushing an object downwards.

Here is the official Newton’s Formula for calculating Force,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/15.png"/><br>
</p>

where,<br>
F — Force pushing the object (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
m — Mass of the pushed object (measured in kilograms: kg);<br>
a — Real Acceleration of the pushed object during the given second (measured in meter/second²: m/s²), or in other words, — Real Increase in Velocity of the pushed object per the given second (measured in meter/second/second: m/s/s).

In my opinion, the true Newton’s Formula for Force is different, but the official Newton’s formula for Force works correctly in some cases.

Throughout this paper, we will consider each of these cases:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/cases.png"/><br>
</p>

For now, let's consider CASE #2 where the official formula for Force works correctly.

CASE #2

A 20 kg object (metal solid object) is free-falling during 30 seconds.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/16.png"/><br>
</p>

In this case, during every moment, Gravitational Force (Invisible hand) is pushing the 20 kg object downwards.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/17.png"/><br>
</p>

We want to calculate Force (Gravitational Force) pushing the 20 kg object.

ATTENTION: The official Newton’s formula for calculating Force works absolutely correctly in CASE #2.

Let’s take a close look at what is happening there, at what is going on.

So.

At the beginning of the 1st second of the free-falling, Velocity of this pushed 20 kg object (v) is 0 (m/s), and next the object starts free-falling.

Throughout the whole falling, Velocity of the pushed object (v) is increased uniformly, incl. uniformly during any given second.

So at the beginning of the 2nd second of the free-falling, Velocity of the pushed object (v) becomes 9.8 (m/s). <i>We (people) know all exact numbers about “free-falling“ by well-known experiments.</i>

Next, 

at the beginning of the 3rd second, Velocity of the pushed object (v) becomes 19.6 (m/s), 

at the beginning of the 4th second — 29.4 (m/s),

at the beginning of the 5th second — 39.2 (m/s),

an so on.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/0.png"/><br>
  <i>We people know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments</i>
</p>


*It is important to keep in mind that when we people consider Gravitational Force (Work of Gravitational Force) and Free-Falling in general, we do not take into account the air resistance.*


As we can see, during any given second Velocity of the pushed 20 kg object is evenly increased by 9.8 (m/s).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/18.png"/><br>
  <i>We people know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments and simple<br>
   calculations</i>
</p>

So Real Increase in Velocity of the pushed object per ANY given second (<b>Δv</b>) is always the same,

<b>Δv</b> = <b>9.8</b> m/s per second;

or, in other words,

Real Acceleration of the pushed object during any given second (<b>a</b>) is always the same,

<b>a</b> = <b>9.8</b> m/s².

The Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) pushing the 20 kg object downwards while free-falling can be correctly calculated through the official Newton’s Formula this way:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/19.png"/><br>
</p>

as the product of Mass of the pushed object, <b>m</b> (in our case, <b>m</b> = 20 kg) and Real Acceleration of the pushed object during any given second, <b>a</b> (in our case, <b>a</b> = 9.8 m/s²):

<b>F</b> = <b>20</b> (kg) * <b>9.8</b> (m/s²) = <b>196</b> (kg*m/s²) = <b>196</b> Newtons

or, in other words,

as the product of Mass of the pushed object, <b>m</b> (in our case, <b>m</b> = 20 kg) and Real Increase in Velocity of the pushed object per any given second, <b>Δv</b> (in our case, <b>Δv</b> = 9.8 m/s per second):

<b>F</b> = <b>20</b> (kg) * <b>9.8</b> (m/s/s) = <b>196</b> (kg*m/s/s) = <b>196</b> Newtons

As we can see, the unit of measure for Force is Newton.

In other words, Force is measured in Newtons.

Also, as we can see, the dimensional formula of Newton is,

Newton = kg*m / s²,

or

Newton = kg * m /s /s.

Now, we might say that the Gravitational Force pushing downwards the 20 kg object is equal to <b>196</b> Newtons.

Or in other words, we might also say that the Effort with which the Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing downwards the 20 kg object is equal to <b>196</b> Newtons.

In addition, we might note that during ANY given second of this pushing (during ANY given second of this free-falling) the value of Force is always the same, <b>196</b> Newtons.

But if there a 50 kg object is free-falling downwards during 30 seconds,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/20.png"/><br>
</p>

the Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) pushing downwards this 50 kg object is already equal to 490 Newtons:

F = 50 (kg) * 9.8 (m/s²) = 490 Newtons

490 Newtons !

In this case, Gravitational Force is bigger.

This means that the more Mass of the pushed object, the more Gravitational Force pushing this object.

Now, we might say that while free-falling during every moment:

· the 20 kg object is being pushed by Force equal to 196 Newtons,

· the 50 kg object is being pushed by Force equal to 490 Newtons.

## B. Official Concept of Work and Official Concept of Energy

We already know that that official science considers that the Universe/Nature in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

Plus, we already know that official science thinks that the Universe (Big Organism) can do its work by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand).

Also, we already know that in the vision of official science all that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) can EVER be doing during ANY given moment of time is to only be pushing an object downwards.

I absolutely agree with everything above.

With this all being held in mind, we go on.

Now let's consider the "Official" Concept of Work and "Official" Concept of Energy.

Both these concepts are easier to understand also through the same CASE #1 familiar to us.

CASE #1

So, let’s again consider the case where the 20 kg object is free-falling during 30 seconds.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/16.png"/><br>
</p>

In this case, throughout any given moment, Gravitational Force (Invisible hand) is pushing the 20 kg object downwards.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/17.png"/><br>
</p>

>ATTENTION: The official Newton’s formula for Force works absolutely correctly in CASE #1.

Let’s take again a closer look at what is happening there — at what is going on.

So.

As we already know, during any given second the Velocity of the pushed 20 kg object is evenly increased by 9.8 (m/s).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/18.png"/><br>
  <i>We people know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments and simple<br>
   calculations</i>
</p>


Importantly, during every moment Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing the 20 kg object downwards and ONLY AS A RESULT of that pushing, the pushed object starts moving downwards and is increasing its velocity uniformly during every second.

The Distance (D) moved by the pushed object during any given second is as follows:  

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/21.png"/><br>
  <i>We people know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments and simple<br>
   calculations</i>
</p>

Please pay attention to Summary Distance (D) — the right column.

Distance (D) during the 1st second is 4.9 meters;<br>
Distance (D) during the 2nd second is 14.7 meters;<br>
Distance (D) during the 3rd second is 24.5 meters;<br>
Distance (D) during the 4th second is 34.3 meters;<br>
Distance (D) during the 5th second is 44.1 meters.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/22.png"/><br>
  <i>We people know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments</i>

So what is Work in the vision of official science?

"Official" science says that while the free-falling of the 20 kg object, during every second, the Universe (Big Organism) is doing Work by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand), pushing the 20 kg object downwards. 

And I absolutely agree with this above.

But I don’t agree with the official formula by which official science calculates Work:

W = F * D

where,<br>
W — Work done by Force during the given second (measured in Joules: J);<br>
F — Force pushing the object during the given second (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
D — Distance moved by the pushed object during the given second (measured in meters: m).

Since while free-falling of the 20 kg object the Force (Gravitational Force) is the same, 196 Newtons (196 N) during any given second; and since during any given second the pushed 20 kg object is moving the distance different in size, official science says the following:

Work being done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand)

during the 1st second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 4.9 (m) = 960.4 Joules

during the 2nd second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 14.7 (m) = 2881.2 Joules

during the 3rd second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 24.5 (m) = 4802.0 Joules

during the 4th second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 34.3 (m) = 6722.8 Joules

during the 5th second is:<br>
W = 196 (N) * 44.1 (m) = 8643.6 Joules

ATTENTION: "Official" science states that while free-falling

the more Distance (D) traveled by the object during the given second, the more Work is done by the same Gravitational Force during the given second.

This statement above is absolutely wrong and this is explained in Discovery #1.
  
Now about Energy.

"Official" science says that while free-falling of the 20 kg object, during any given second the Universe (Big Organism), while doing Work, is spending some Energy (resource) of the Universe (Big Organism) on this Work.  

And I also absolutely agree with this above.

But I don’t agree with the official formula by which official science calculates Energy:
  
E = F * D

where,<br>
E — Energy (Resource) being spent by the subject pushing the object during the given second (measured in Joules: J);<br>
F — Force pushing the object during every second (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
D — Distance moved by the pushed object during the given second (measured in meters: m).
  
<i>For example, as the subject this might be you (your Hand) or the Universe (Invisible Hand -- Gravitational Force).</i>

Since while free-falling of the 20 kg object -- during any given second the Force (Gravitational Force) is the same, 196 Newtons (196 N); and since during any given second the pushed 20 kg object is moving the distance different in size, official science says the following:

Energy (Resource) being spent by the Universe on Work

during the 1st second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 4.9 (m) = 960.4 Joules

during the 2nd second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 14.7 (m) = 2881.2 Joules

during the 3rd second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 24.5 (m) = 4802.0 Joules

during the 4th second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 34.3 (m) = 6722.8 Joules

during the 5th second is:<br>
E = 196 (N) * 44.1 (m) = 8643.6 Joules

ATTENTION: "Official" science states that while free-falling 

the more Distance (D) traveled by the object during the given second, the more Energy (Resource) is being spent by the Universe during the given second.

This statement above is absolutely wrong and this is explained in Discovery #1

Summarizing, "Official" science states that

W = E = F * D

This formula above is absolutely wrong and this is explained in Discovery #1.

>ATTENTION: In my opinion, the "Official" Formula of Work and the "Official" Formula of Energy are absolutely wrong.

As we can see, science believes that the real reason for the difference in the distances is Gravitational Force — the more Distance (D) traveled by the object during any given second, the more Work is done by Gravitational Force during the given second.
  
In other words, science believes that that difference in the distances (9.8 m) is due to the different-in-size Work that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is doing during every second — the more Distance (D) traveled by the object during any given second, the more Work is done by Gravitational Force during the given second.

## 1.1. One of Sufficient Fundamental Errors in Science

This error is called "sufficient" because even this error alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe. It is sufficient.

Through this chapter,  we will see the total wrongness of science of understanding the Universe: 

* the total wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work (W) and Energy (E);
* the total wrongness of using such a unit as the Joule for measuring Work (W) and Energy (E).

In particular, science fails to understand the difference between how Inertia works and how Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) works, and especially, what happens when they (Inertia and Gravitational Force) work simultaneously.

In order to understand this, let’s recall some familiar stuff above, adding some new points.

When you let an apple out of your hand,
  
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/11.png"/><br>
</p>

this apple starts moving downwards (closer to the ground).

Importantly, this apple starts its motion downwards ONLY BECAUSE during every moment Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing this apple downwards (closer to the ground).

But, for example, in cosmos far away from all planets, there is no Gravitational Force (no Invisible Hand) which, during every momenmt, could be pushing an object downwards. So if you let an apple out of your hand, the apple won’t start moving downwards (won’t start moving anywhere).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/14.png"/><br>
</p>

On the other hand, on the Earth, as we already know, there is Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) which, during every momenmt, pushes an object downwards. So if you let an apple out of your hand, the apple starts its motion downwards only thanks to the pushing being done — during every moment — by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand).

Now, let’ learn how Inertia works.

For example, in cosmos far away from all planets, while you hold an apple in your hand, this apple has zero Velocity (v = 0 m/s). 

But when you throw the apple in any certain direction (for example, upwards vertically),

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/23.png"/><br>
</p>

the apple, at the moment of separation from your hand, will have some accumulated non-zero Velocity (say, 10 m/s ); and every moment next, after the separation from your hand, the apple will be moving at this accumulated Velocity (10 m/s).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/24.png"/><br>
</p>

We might call this accumulated Velocity (10 m/s) -- at which the apple is moving with Inertia -- “Inertial Velocity”.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/25.png"/><br>
</p>

Importantly, the apple will be moving at Inertial Velocity (10 m/s) because -- according to Newton's 1st Law -- when the apple is moving with Inertia at Inertial Velocity (10 m/s) this is the same as when the apple is being at rest -- meaning no Work is being done and no Energy (no resource) is being spent in this process.

Newton's 1st law: 

An object at rest remains at rest, or if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.

For Newton, motion by Inertia is the same as being at rest.

So, according to Newton’s 1st Law, when an object is moving with Inertia at Inertial Velocity, then no real Work is being done and no real Energy (no resource) is being spent in this process — it is exactly so because when an object is moving with Inertia at Inertial Velocity this is the same as when the object is being at rest.

And now, let’s go back to our familiar CASE #1 where the 20 kg object is free-falling during 30 seconds.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/16.png"/><br>
  <i>20 kg object which is free-falling</i>
</p>

Or the same Case #1 in this image:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/17.png"/><br>
  <i>Gravitational Force pushing<br>
  downwards the 20 kg object<br>
  during every second</i>
</p>

Let’s analyze this case in detail.

In particular, the 20 kg object is moving the shorter distance of 4.9 meters during the 1st second and the longer distance of 14.7 meters during the 2nd second.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/1.png"/><br>
  <i>We people know all these exact<br> 
   numbers about “free-falling“ through<br>
   well-known experiments</i>
</p>

The difference in the distances is 9.8 meters, 

14.7 (m) - 4.9 (m) = 9.8 m.

Moreover, the difference in the distances is always the same, 9.8 meters:

14.7 (m) - 4.9 (m) = 9.8 m<br>
24.5 (m) - 14.7 (m) = 9.8 m<br>
34.3 (m) - 24.5 (m) = 9.8 m<br>
44.1 (m) - 34.3 (m) = 9.8 m<br>
and so on.

So, the question is what is THE REAL REASON that this free-falling 20 kg object during every second is moving the distance different in size.

Science wrongly believes that this difference in the distances (9.8 m) is due to the "different-in-size" Work that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is doing during any given second.

Unfortunately, science is absolutely wrong.

And right now I will give you the explanation of what is the real reason for this difference in the distances.

Please carefully study this table below describing the free-falling of the 20 kg object during every second (5 seconds in total) — especially the Inertial Distance (D2) being moved by the object during every second (red-colored column).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/table.png"/>
</p>

Please pay attention to:

*  Increase in Velocity during any given second (Δv) is the same — 9.8 m/s;

* Velocity (v) accumulated by the pushed object at the beginning of any given second is precisely Inertial Velocity of the object at the beginning of the given second;

* Inertial Distance (D2) is the distance being moved by the object during any given second due to Inertia  — i.e. not due to Pushing (real Work) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second, but due to Inertia.

The whole thing is that while free-falling, the pushed object during any given second is moving Summary Distance (D) being the sum (the result of the sum) of the two absolutely different sorts of distances, D1 and D2:

D = D1 + D2

where,<br>
D  — Summary Distance the object is moving during the given second, (measured in meters: m);

D1 — Non-Inertial Distance the object is moving during the given second due to the pushing (real Work) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second, i.e. precisely due to real Work of Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second, (measured in meters: m);

D2 — Inertial Distance the object is moving during the given second due to Inertia — i.e. not due to the pushing (real Work) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second, but due to Inertia, (measured in meters: m).

====

Here again Isaac Newton comes into play, again with his 1st Law.

According to Newton’s 1st Law, when an object is moving with inertia, then no real Work is being done and no real Energy (no real resource) is being spent in this process — because when an object is moving with Inertia it is the same when the object is being at rest.

In particular, the wrongness of science lies in misunderstanding the fact that in every “free-falling” there is also the Inertial Motion -- there is the distance the object is moving with Inertia -- i.e. not due to real Work done by any Force, but due to Inertia.

It all means that when the object is moving the Inertial Distance (D2) during any given second of free-falling, no real Work is being done by the Universe and no real Energy (no real resource) is being spent by the Universe.

But in this wrong official formula for Work and Energy:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/26.png"/>
</p>

the Inertial Distance (D2) is mistakenly included in the calculation, and hence mistakenly increases the wrongly calculated Work (W) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during free-falling, and therefore mistakenly increases the wrongly calculated Energy (E) spent by the Universe during free-falling.

Importantly, this happens during any given second of the free-falling

=====

Now, let’s consider, for example, the 1st second of free-falling — in the table it is the “1st second of fall” line.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/table.png"/>
</p>

Importantly, during the 1st second of the free-falling, the object is moving Summary Distance (D) being the sum (the result of the sum) of the two absolutely different sorts of distances, D1 and D2:

D = D1 + D2

In detai,

D1 is Non-Inertial Distance the object is moving during the given second due to the pushing (real Work) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second:

D1 = AddedVelocity/2 * t = Δv/2 * t = 9.8 (m/s) / 2 * 1 (s) = 4.9 meters

Note: Non-Inertial Distance (D1) is the same (4.9 m) during any given second.

D2 is Inertial Distance the object is moving during the given second due to Inertia — i.e. not due to the pushing (real Work) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second, but due to Inertia.

Since at the beginning of the 1st second the object hasn't the Accumulated Velocity (v = 0 m/s), it means that during the 1st second the object isn’t moving inertially (with Inertia, by Inertia):

D2 = v * t = 0 (m/s) * 1 (s) = 0 meters

So Summary Distance (D) during the 1st second is:

D = D1 + D2 = 4.9 (m) + 0 (m) = 4.9 meters

And now, let’s consider the 2nd second of free-falling — in the table it is the “2nd second of fall” line.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/table.png"/>
</p>

Importantly, during the 2nd second of the free-falling, the object is moving Summary Distance (D) being the sum (the result of the sum) of the two absolutely different sorts of distances, D1 and D2:

D = D1 + D2

In detai,

D1 is Non-Inertial Distance the object is moving during the given second due to the pushing (real Work) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second:

D1 = AddedVelocity/2 * t = Δv/2 * t = 9.8 (m/s) / 2 * 1 (s) = 4.9 meters

Note: Non-Inertial Distance (D1) is the same (4.9 m) during any given second.

D2 is Inertial Distance the object is moving during the given second due to Inertia — i.e. not due to the pushing (real Work) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the given second, but due to Inertia.

Since at the beginning of the 2nd second the object has the Accumulated Velocity (v = 9.8 m/s), it means that during the 1st second the object is moving inertially (with Inertia, by Inertia)

D2 = v * t = 9.8 (m/s) * 1 (s) = 9.8 meters

Importantly, if at the beginning of the 2nd second we might turn off the Gravitational Force, the object anyway would still be moving at Inertial Velocity (9.8 m/s) during the entire 2nd second and further.

So Summary Distance (D) during the 2nd second is:

D = D1 + D2 = 4.9 (m) + 9.8 (m) = 14.7 meters

According to Newton’s 1st Law, when an object is moving with inertia, then no real Work is being done and no real Energy (no real resource) is being spent in this process — because when an object is moving with Inertia it is the same when the object is being at rest.

Since the Inertial Distance (D2 = 9.8 meters) during the 2nd second is absolutely irrelevant to the pushing (real Work) done by Gravitational Force during the 2nd second, then the Inertial Distance (D2 = 9.8 meters) should not increase the calculated Work (W) of Gravitational Force during the 2nd second and the calculated Energy (E) .

But in this wrong official formula for Work and Energy:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/26.png"/>
</p>

the Inertial Distance (D2) is mistakenly included in the calculation, and hence mistakenly increases the wrongly calculated Work (W) done by Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) during the 2nd second of free-falling, and therefore mistakenly increases the wrongly calculated Energy (E) spent by the Universe during the 2nd second of free-falling.

Importantly, this happens during any given second of the free-falling -- please carefully study the table above!

And this all means that the base official formula for Work and Energy:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/26.png"/>
</p>

is absolutely wrong!

Importantly, this wrong official formula for Work and Energy is base and thus strictly defines all other “official formulas“ for Work and Energy, including the official formula for potential Energy (Ep) and the official formula for kinetic Energy (Ek):

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/27.png"/>
</p>

which means that these official formulas for potential Energy (Ep) and kinetic Energy (Ek):

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/28.png"/>
</p>

are also absolutely wrong!

So, all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy -- importantly, being fundamental -- are absolutely wrong. Now, the wrongness of all these official formulas is a proven fact.

> ## The wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy is a proven fact.

And since all these wrong formulas also strictly define the dimensional formulas of the Joule (Joule = Newton * meter = kilogram * meter² / second²), it all means that the Joule is the absolutely wrong unit of measure for Work and Energy!

Of course, this all means the total wrongness to use the Joule as the unit of measure for Work and Energy!

So.

Official science mistakenly believes that that difference in the distances (9.8 m) is due to the different-in-size Work that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is doing during every second — the more Distance (D) traveled by the object during any given second, the more Work is done by Gravitational Force during the given second.

The real reason for this difference in the distances is not Gravitational Force -- not Work of Gravitational Force.

The real reason for this difference in the distances IS Inertia.

A more Distance (D) traveled by the object during any given second is just due the more Inertial Distance (D2) traveled by the object during the given second -- not more Work done by Gravitational Force during the given second.

> ### The more Distance (D) traveled by the object during any given second, the more Inertial Distance (D2) traveled by the object during the given second.

Unfortunately, official science absolutely fails to understand this.

Since the concept of Energy is basic in science, even this fundamental error alone destroys the entire concept of science of understanding the Universe.

There is the fundamental incorrectness of science.

Right now, the biggest, LITERALLY-CRYING, logical errors in the very fundamentals of science are strongly hindering the progress of our civilization.
